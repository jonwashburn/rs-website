                <h2>From Physics to Psychology</h2>
                <p>The Theory of Us represents the application layer of Recognition Physics—where the fundamental physics of reality meets the lived human experience. Here we explore how RS principles illuminate every aspect of human knowledge and existence.</p>
                
                <h3>Consciousness Studies Revolution</h3>
                <p>Recognition Physics finally provides the mathematical framework that consciousness studies has been seeking. The LISTEN operation explains qualia, the binding problem dissolves when we understand consciousness as the universe's self-recognition function, and free will emerges naturally from the 45-Gap's inherent uncomputability.</p>
                
                <h3>Psychology as Applied RS</h3>
                <p>Mental health conditions can be understood as patterns of Ledger decoherence. Depression represents a "stuck" state with high J(x), while anxiety manifests as chaotic probability current fluctuations. Therapeutic interventions work by restoring coherent recognition patterns.</p>
                
                <h3>Sociology and Collective Consciousness</h3>
                <p>Social movements, cultural evolution, and collective behavior follow RS principles. Groups that achieve coherence (low collective J(x)) naturally influence reality's probability currents more effectively. This explains everything from viral memes to revolutionary movements.</p>
                
                <h3>Economics as Energy Flow</h3>
                <p>Money is simply tokenized recognition—a way to track and exchange coherence quanta (E_coh) through human systems. Economic cycles reflect the natural breathing of the Ledger, with crashes occurring when artificial patterns diverge too far from optimal φ-scaling.</p>
                
                <h3>Art, Creativity, and Innovation</h3>
                <p>Creative breakthroughs happen when consciousness achieves temporary direct Ledger access, downloading information from the probability field. Artists and innovators are those who've learned to reliably induce these states of enhanced recognition.</p>
