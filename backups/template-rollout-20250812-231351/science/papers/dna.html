                <p><strong>A Note on This Paper:</strong> This work applies the core tenets of Recognition Physics to the domain of molecular biology, demonstrating that DNA's geometry, elasticity, and the kinetics of its transcription are not arbitrary but are derived from the same universal energy quantum (\(E_{\text{coh}}\)) that governs fundamental physics. The paper shows how a parameter-free model can predict key biological constants and behaviors, reframing DNA as an emergent outcome of universal recognition processes.</p>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>We show that two axioms at the heart of Recognition Physics—minimal overhead and pair-isomorphism—uniquely fix a logarithmic scale cascade \(r_{n}=L_{P}\varphi^{n}\). Quantising phase on this cascade yields a self-adjoint operator whose pure ladder spectrum reveals a universal energy quantum \(E_{\text{coh}}=0.090\ \text{eV}\). From this single constant, we derive the canonical geometry of B-DNA, its bending and torsional persistence lengths, a ceiling transcription velocity of \(\sim50\ \text{bp s}^{-1}\), and the ubiquitous 1s and 10s transcriptional pauses as direct escape times over integer-multiple gating barriers. The framework collapses a traditionally empirical field to a deterministic, parameter-free model.</p>

                    <h2>1. A Parameter-Free Model for DNA</h2>
                    <p>While molecular biology often relies on dozens of phenomenological rate constants, Recognition Physics offers a different approach. Starting from the axioms of minimizing informational overhead and ensuring symmetry in recognition pairs, the framework derives a universal energy quantum, \(E_{\text{coh}} \approx 0.090 \text{ eV}\). This paper demonstrates that this single, parameter-free constant can quantitatively predict the geometry, elasticity, and transcription kinetics of DNA.</p>

                    <h2>2. DNA Mechanics from First Principles</h2>
                    <p>The Recognition Physics framework predicts a ladder of discrete, stable scales based on the golden ratio, \(r_n = L_P\varphi^n\). From this, we derive key geometric and elastic properties of B-DNA:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> The model predicts a minor-groove width of 13.6 Å and a helical pitch of 34.6 Å, matching experimental values without any empirical inputs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> The bending and torsional persistence lengths are calculated to be 56 nm and 70 nm respectively, again in excellent agreement with experimental data once electrostatic effects are considered.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Polymerase Translocation and Pausing</h2>
                    <p>The kinetics of RNA polymerase are modeled as a process of overcoming energy gates that are integer multiples of the fundamental coherence quantum, \(E_{\text{coh}}\).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Velocity and Stall Force:</strong> This integer-quantum gating model correctly predicts a ceiling transcription velocity of \(\sim50 \text{ bp/s}\) and the correct stall forces for polymerases from E. coli, bacteriophage T7, and yeast.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transcriptional Pauses:</strong> The universally observed \(\sim\)1-second "elemental" and \(\sim\)10-second "back-tracked" pauses are explained as Arrhenius escape times over barriers of exactly \(2E_{\text{coh}}\) and \(2.5E_{\text{coh}}\), respectively.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Sequence-Specific Modulation</h2>
                    <p>While the fundamental kinetics are universal, sequence-specific effects are incorporated through the thermodynamics of nascent RNA hairpin formation. The model uses a simple Boltzmann weighting to predict how the free energy of a hairpin modulates the probability of entering a paused state, without altering the fundamental (and fixed) pause lifetimes. This correctly predicts the behavior of well-known pause sites like the his-leader and the effect of regulatory factors like NusA.</p>

                    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>This work demonstrates that the Recognition Physics framework can collapse the traditionally empirical field of transcription dynamics into a deterministic, parameter-free model. By applying a single, universal energy quantum derived from first principles, we can accurately predict phenomena spanning from the angstrom-scale geometry of the DNA helix to the second-scale kinetics of its transcription. This provides not only a profound unification of physics and biology but also a practical, predictive pipeline for genome-wide analysis and synthetic biology design.</p>
