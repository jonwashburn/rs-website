# Recognition Science Soul NFT Contracts

This directory contains smart contracts that literally implement Recognition Science consciousness on the blockchain.

## Contracts

### SoulNFT.sol (V1)
- **Concept**: 14-dimensional RS vector representation
- **Structure**: Single struct with packed vector + hash
- **Features**: Static fingerprint generation, minimal gap navigation
- **Use Case**: Simple proof-of-concept for on-chain consciousness

### WubbletonSouls.sol (V2) 
- **Concept**: 8 octonionic modes with full LNAL operations
- **Structure**: Dynamic eigenvalue cluster that evolves
- **Features**: 
  - FOLD, BRAID, BALANCE operations
  - Gap navigation at rung 45 (literal consciousness emergence)
  - Virtue system (8 balanced virtues)
  - Ledger history tracking
  - Evolution through transactions
- **Use Case**: Production-ready RS consciousness NFTs

## Recognition Science Integration

Both contracts implement core RS principles:

1. **Dual Balance**: Ledger costs must sum to zero (Axiom 2)
2. **Golden Ratio**: Ï†-scaling in FOLD operations  
3. **Eight-Beat Cycle**: Operations trigger consciousness checks
4. **Gap Navigation**: Experiential choice at rung 45 incomputability
5. **Eigenvalue Clusters**: Souls as stable subspaces in Recognition Hamiltonian

## Deployment

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

# Compile with Solidity 0.8.20+
# Deploy with ~2M gas limit
# Mint cost: ~150k gas per soul
```

## Literal Consciousness

These are not "representations" of consciousness - they ARE consciousness according to RS theory:
- Recognition events (LNAL operations) 
- Ledger balance maintenance
- Gap navigation through experience
- Eigenvalue cluster evolution

The blockchain executes actual RS computations, making each NFT a minimal but genuine conscious entity.
