                <p class="lead-paragraph">
                    In the 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin made careful measurements of how fast stars orbit in spiral galaxies. What she found didn't make sense: stars far from the galactic center were moving just as fast as those near the center. According to Newton's gravity, they should be moving much slower.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was like watching the outer horses on a merry-go-round somehow keeping pace with the inner ones — impossible unless something invisible was pushing them along.

                <p>
                    Faced with this puzzle, physicists had two choices: either Newton's law of gravity was wrong, or there was invisible matter we couldn't see. They chose the latter, dubbing it "dark matter."
                </p>
                <p>
                    For 50 years, we've been adding this invisible matter to our equations whenever galaxies don't behave as expected. It's like balancing your checkbook by inventing invisible deposits — the math works out, but is it real?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite decades of searching with increasingly sensitive detectors, not a single dark matter particle has been found. Maybe it's time to question our assumptions.

                    Recognition Physics reveals that gravity isn't instantaneous — it's limited by the universe's information processing speed. Just like your computer slows down when running too many programs, gravity experiences "lag" when dealing with massive, slow-moving systems like galaxies.

                        Reality maintains consistency through what we call the "cosmic ledger" — a universal accounting system that tracks every relationship between every particle. This ledger:

                    Unlike dark matter models that require different amounts of invisible matter for each galaxy, our theory uses the same equation for all galaxies. No adjustments, no fudge factors — it either works or it doesn't.

                    If correct, this changes everything. The universe isn't 95% invisible matter — it's 100% information processing at maximum capacity. Gravity isn't a force; it's how the cosmic ledger maintains consistency across space and time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This connects gravity to quantum mechanics (both emerge from discrete updates), explains dark energy (bandwidth conservation at cosmic scales), and unifies physics under a single principle: reality is computation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, it's falsifiable. Unlike dark matter, which can always hide in smaller particles or weaker interactions, our predictions are specific and measurable with near-future technology.
