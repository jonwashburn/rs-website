    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>DNA is a recognition information storage system that encodes biological patterns using a four-letter recognition alphabet. Its structure and function are fundamental to the processes of life, serving as the blueprint for the development and functioning of all living organisms.</p>

<section class="definition">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule composed of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix. Each strand is made up of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the basic units of DNA. The four types of nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The sequence of these nucleotides encodes genetic information.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
        <p>The information content in DNA can be expressed mathematically as:</p>
        <p>Information = -Î£(p<sub>i</sub> log(p<sub>i</sub>))</p>
        <p>where p<sub>i</sub> is the probability of each nucleotide occurring in a given sequence.</p>

<section class="in-plain-english">
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>DNA is like a recipe book for living things. It contains all the instructions needed to build and maintain an organism. Each "letter" in the DNA sequence corresponds to a specific instruction, and the order of these letters determines how proteins are made, which are crucial for various functions in the body.</p>
</section>

<section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding DNA is essential for many fields, including genetics, medicine, and biotechnology. It plays a critical role in heredity, evolution, and the functioning of cells. Advances in DNA research have led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as genetic engineering, personalized medicine, and forensic science.</p>
</section>

<section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>DNA works by storing information in the sequence of its nucleotides. This information is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into proteins. The specific sequences of nucleotides determine the characteristics of the proteins produced, influencing everything from physical traits to susceptibility to diseases.</p>

<section class="key-properties">
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Double Helix Structure:</strong> The coiled shape of DNA allows for efficient storage of genetic information.</li>
        <li><strong>Base Pairing:</strong> Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine, ensuring accurate replication.</li>
        <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The structure of DNA is stable, allowing it to preserve genetic information over generations.</li>
        <li><strong>Replication:</strong> DNA can replicate itself, enabling cell division and inheritance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
        <p>The mathematical representation of DNA sequences can be analyzed using combinatorial methods and information theory. For example, the total number of possible sequences of length n can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>N = 4<sup>n</sup></p>
        <p>This formula arises because there are four possible nucleotides at each position in the sequence.</p>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>Some common misconceptions about DNA include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All DNA is the same across all organisms. (In reality, DNA varies greatly between species.)</li>
        <li>DNA determines everything about an organism. (While DNA plays a crucial role, environmental factors also significantly influence development and behavior.)</li>

<section class="faqs">
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is the function of DNA?</h3>
    <p>DNA stores and transmits genetic information necessary for the growth, development, and reproduction of living organisms.</p>
    
    <h3>How is DNA replicated?</h3>
    <p>DNA replication occurs through a process where the double helix unwinds, and each strand serves as a template for creating a new complementary strand.</p>
    
    <h3>Can DNA be modified?</h3>
    <p>Yes, DNA can be modified through techniques such as CRISPR, which allows for precise edits to the genetic code.</p>
