    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Coherence energy is a fundamental energy scale that sets the mass of all particles in the universe. It is a critical concept in understanding the underlying structure of matter and energy in the framework of physics.</p>
</section>

<section class="definition">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>The coherence energy, denoted as \(E_{\text{coh}}\), is defined as:</p>
    <math-note>
        \(E_{\text{coh}} = 0.090 \, \text{eV}\)
    </math-note>

<section class="in-plain-english">
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Coherence energy represents a specific energy level that is essential for the mass of all particles. It acts as a baseline energy scale in the universe, influencing how particles acquire mass and interact with one another. This energy level is not just an arbitrary number; it is derived from fundamental principles of physics, making it a cornerstone of our understanding of particle physics.</p>
</section>

<section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding coherence energy is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps explain why particles have the masses they do, which is fundamental to the Standard Model of particle physics. Secondly, it provides insights into the nature of forces and interactions at the quantum level. Lastly, coherence energy plays a role in cosmology, influencing the behavior of the universe at large scales.</p>
</section>

<section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Coherence energy arises from the principles of quantum mechanics and the structure of spacetime. It is linked to the way particles interact and the energy scales at which these interactions occur. The coherence energy sets a threshold for the mass of particles, ensuring that they behave consistently within the framework of quantum field theory.</p>
