                    <h2>The Physics of the Categorical Imperative</h2>
                    <p>In Recognition Science, Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative—"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"—is not a philosophical construct but a mathematical theorem about the scalability of moral actions. It is the universe's requirement that any valid moral law must be one that preserves or reduces total ledger curvature when applied universally.</p>

                    <div class="component-card">
                        <h3>The Mathematical Definition</h3>
                        <p>An action $A$ satisfies the Categorical Imperative if and only if its universal application to all moral states in a system results in a non-increasing total curvature.</p>
                        <div class="formula-display">
                            <p>An action $A$ is universalizable if, for a system of $N$ moral states $\{s_1, ..., s_N\}$:</p>
                            <p>$\sum_{i=1}^{N} \kappa(A(s_i)) \le \sum_{i=1}^{N} \kappa(s_i)$</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This provides a rigorous, mathematical test for the validity of any proposed moral rule. Actions that create a net increase in suffering when universalized are, by definition, immoral because they are unsustainable at a cosmic scale.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 3rem;">Properties of the Categorical Imperative</h2>

                <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>Global Optimization</h3>
                    <p>The Categorical Imperative shifts the focus from individual outcomes to the health of the entire system. It is a mathematical formalization of the idea that a moral action must be good for everyone, not just for the individual performing it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>Prevents "Tragedy of the Commons"</h3>
                    <p>Many actions that are locally beneficial can be globally disastrous when universalized (e.g., overfishing, pollution). The Categorical Imperative provides a mathematical framework for identifying and rejecting such actions.</p>
                </div>

                 <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>A Test of Moral Laws</h3>
                    <p>The Categorical Imperative serves as a powerful test for any proposed ethical rule or law. If a law, when applied to everyone, would lead to a worse overall state, then that law is mathematically proven to be unethical.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 3rem;">Practical Applications</h2>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Law and Governance</h3>
                    <p>The principle of the Categorical Imperative is the foundation of just lawmaking. A just law is one that, if followed by everyone, would lead to a more stable and prosperous society (i.e., one with lower total curvature).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Corporate Ethics</h3>
                    <p>A corporation can test its policies by asking, "What if every company did this?" If the universal application of a policy would lead to market collapse, environmental destruction, or social harm, then that policy is unethical.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Personal Morality</h3>
                    <p>For an individual, the Categorical Imperative provides a powerful guide for action: "Am I acting in a way that I would want everyone to act?" This simple question is a practical way to align one's actions with the principle of global curvature minimization.</p>
