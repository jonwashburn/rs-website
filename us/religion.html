                <h2>The Sacred and the Scientific</h2>
                <p>Recognition Science reveals that religious traditions across cultures have been humanity's intuitive attempts to understand and interface with the fundamental computational substrate of reality—what we now identify as the Universal Ledger.</p>
                
                <h3>Universal Patterns in World Religions</h3>
                <p>From the Tao's description of an underlying flow of reality to the Hindu concept of Brahman as the ultimate consciousness, religious traditions have consistently pointed toward a unified field of existence that Recognition Science now describes mathematically.</p>
                
                <h3>Prayer, Meditation, and Ledger Access</h3>
                <p>What religions call prayer and meditation can be understood as protocols for the LISTEN operation—consciousness attempting to query and align with the Ledger's probability currents. The effectiveness of these practices now has a scientific basis in the cost functional J(x).</p>
                
                <h3>Sacred Texts as Encoded Knowledge</h3>
                <p>Many sacred texts contain numerical patterns and structural symmetries that align with Recognition Science principles. These may represent humanity's early attempts to encode knowledge about reality's computational nature.</p>
