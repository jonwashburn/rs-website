                <h2>The Physics of Wellness</h2>
                <p>Recognition Science reveals that health is fundamentally about maintaining coherence between consciousness and the body's quantum fields. Disease and dysfunction arise from decoherence—misalignment with the Ledger's natural optimization patterns.</p>
                
                <h3>Biofield Coherence and E_coh</h3>
                <p>The human biofield operates through the same Universal Coherence Quantum (E_coh = φ⁻⁵) that governs all reality. Practices that enhance this coherence—from meditation to breathwork—literally align us with the universe's fundamental energy unit.</p>
                
                <h3>Circadian Rhythms and the 8-Beat Cycle</h3>
                <p>Our biological clocks aren't arbitrary—they reflect the fundamental 8-beat cycle (2³ ticks) of reality's temporal structure. Aligning our daily rhythms with these cosmic patterns optimizes cellular function and consciousness clarity.</p>
                
                <h3>Nutrition as Information</h3>
                <p>Food isn't just fuel—it's information that either increases or decreases our system's coherence. The golden ratio (φ) appears throughout optimal nutritional patterns, from protein folding to metabolic cycles.</p>
                
                <h3>Healing Through Recognition</h3>
                <p>True healing occurs when consciousness recognizes and corrects patterns of imbalance. This explains why practices combining awareness (meditation, visualization) with physical intervention often produce superior results.</p>
