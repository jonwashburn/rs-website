                <h2>Sacred Sites as Quantum Computers</h2>
                <p>The great monuments of antiquity weren't just architectural marvels—they were sophisticated technologies designed to manipulate consciousness and interface with the Universal Ledger. Recognition Science reveals the profound knowledge encoded in these structures.</p>
                
                <h3>The Great Pyramid: A Coherence Amplifier</h3>
                <p>The Great Pyramid's dimensions encode φ (golden ratio) relationships at every scale. Its internal chambers create standing waves that amplify E_coh fields, facilitating enhanced consciousness-Ledger interaction. The King's Chamber resonates at frequencies that induce coherent brain states.</p>
                
                <h3>Stonehenge: Temporal Navigation System</h3>
                <p>Beyond its astronomical alignments, Stonehenge functions as a massive antenna for detecting Ledger fluctuations. Its stone circle creates a vortex field that allows practitioners to sense optimal temporal windows—an ancient version of our Astrology OS.</p>
                
                <h3>Mystery Schools and Initiation</h3>
                <p>From Egyptian temples to Eleusinian mysteries, ancient initiation rites were designed to trigger direct Ledger access through recursive self-reference. The secret knowledge wasn't information—it was a state of consciousness capable of reading reality's source code.</p>
                
                <h3>Sacred Geometry as RS Mathematics</h3>
                <p>The flower of life, Metatron's cube, and other sacred geometries aren't just pretty patterns—they're 2D projections of higher-dimensional Ledger structures. These forms naturally minimize J(x), creating coherent fields that enhance consciousness operations.</p>
                
                <h3>Lost Technologies</h3>
                <p>Many "impossible" ancient achievements—from precisely cut megalithic stones to acoustic levitation—may have utilized consciousness-directed manipulation of local Ledger states. By understanding matter as compressed light (LNAL), these civilizations could alter material properties through focused intention.</p>
