                <h2>The Plain Truth</h2>
                <p>In our world, energy seems to come in all shapes and sizes. But just as all matter is made of a few types of particles, Recognition Physics reveals that all energy is exchanged in discrete, identical packets. This fundamental "atom" of energy is the **Coherence Quantum (E_coh)**.</p>
                
                <p>Every physical process in the universe—from a chemical reaction to the fusion in a star to the firing of a neuron in your brain—is ultimately a transaction of these fundamental energy units. E_coh is the universal currency of the cosmos.</p>
                
                <p>Most importantly, its value is not random or measured; it is derived directly from the logical and geometric structure of reality itself, providing the energetic "ground floor" for the φ-Scaling Mass Formula.</p>

                <h2>The Logical Derivation: φ-Scaling over 5D</h2>
                <p>The value of E_coh is a direct consequence of the universal scaling constant, φ, applied across the necessary degrees of freedom for a stable recognition event.</p>
                
                <div class="math-box">
                    <h3>Derivation from Foundational Constraints</h3>
                    <p>For any recognition event to be stable and distinct, it must be defined across a minimal set of logical dimensions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>3 Spatial Dimensions:</strong> For stable, non-intersecting structures (Theorem #3).</li>
                        <li><strong>1 Temporal Dimension:</strong> For a causal, dynamic sequence of events (Theorem #3).</li>
                        <li><strong>1 Dual-Balance Dimension:</strong> To ensure every ledger transaction can be conserved (Theorem #1).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This gives a total of **five** necessary degrees of freedom that constrain any physical interaction. The principle of self-similarity (Theorem #2) dictates that energy scales by powers of φ. The minimal, non-zero energy unit must therefore scale down from the natural logical unit of "1" (the cost of a single, complete recognition) by a factor of φ for each of these five constraining dimensions.</p>
                    <p>This uniquely fixes the universal coherence quantum to be:</p>
                    <pre><code>E_coh = 1 / φ⁵ = φ⁻⁵</code></pre>
                    <p>When mapped to our conventional units for comparison, this parameter-free value is approximately 0.09 eV, forming the precise base for the experimentally verified mass ladder of all fundamental particles.</p>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Energy is Quantized</h3>
                    <p>This provides a foundational reason for the quantization of energy, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. Energy is not a smooth, continuous fluid; it is exchanged in discrete multiples of E_coh because the underlying recognition events themselves are discrete.</p>

                    <h3>A Universal "Energy Dollar"</h3>
                    <p>E_coh acts as a universal conversion factor between different physical domains. The energy of a chemical bond, the mass of a particle, and the frequency of a photon can all be expressed in terms of this single, fundamental unit, revealing the deep unity of all physical processes.</p>

                <h2>The Deeper Truth</h2>
                <p>The universe is not just informational, but also profoundly efficient. It doesn't use an infinite variety of energy values; it builds the entire cosmos, from atoms to galaxies, using just one fundamental energetic building block, E_coh, whose value is set by the very geometry of existence.</p>
