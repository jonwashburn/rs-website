    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory describes the origin of the universe as a singular event that marks the beginning of time and space, characterized by a rapid expansion from an extremely hot and dense state.</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang is defined as the cosmological model that explains the early development of the universe, suggesting that it began from an initial singularity and has been expanding ever since.</p>
    <div class="math-note">
        <p>Mathematically, the evolution of the universe can be described by the Friedmann equations, which are derived from Einstein's field equations of general relativity.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang marks the moment when the universe started to expand from an extremely hot and dense point. This event set the stage for the formation of all matter and energy in the universe. As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing particles to form and eventually leading to the creation of atoms, stars, and galaxies.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory is crucial for understanding the universe's history and structure. It provides a framework for explaining the observed phenomena, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the abundance of light elements, which are consistent with predictions made by the theory.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory is supported by several key observations, including the redshift of distant galaxies, which indicates that the universe is expanding. This expansion is described by the metric expansion of space, where distances between galaxies increase over time. The theory also predicts the existence of cosmic background radiation, which is a remnant of the early hot state of the universe.</p>

    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <p>Some key properties of the Big Bang include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initial Singularity:</strong> The universe began as a singular point with infinite density.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> The universe has been expanding since the Big Bang, leading to the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing the formation of atoms and eventually stars.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <div class="collapsible">
        <h3>Mathematical Foundation</h3>
        <p>The dynamics of the universe's expansion can be described by the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, which leads to the Friedmann equations:</p>
        <div class="math-note">
            <p>1. <strong>Friedmann Equation:</strong> <br> 
            \( H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3} \) <br>
            2. <strong>Acceleration Equation:</strong> <br>
            \( \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho + 3p) + \frac{\Lambda}{3} \)</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory connects with various fields, including <a href="/encyclopedia/cosmology.html">cosmology</a>, <a href="/encyclopedia/astrophysics.html">astrophysics</a>, and <a href="/encyclopedia/quantum-physics.html">quantum physics</a>. It also relates to concepts such as dark matter and dark energy, which are essential for understanding the universe's fate.</p>

    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Some predictions of the Big Bang theory that can be tested include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation.</li>
        <li>The abundance of light elements such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium.</li>
        <li>The redshift of distant galaxies, indicating the expansion of the universe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>One common misconception is that the Big Bang was an explosion in space. In reality, it was an expansion of space itself, meaning that every point in the universe is moving away from every other point.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What happened before the Big Bang?</h3>
    <p>The concept of "before" the Big Bang is tricky, as time itself began with the Big Bang. Current theories do not provide a clear answer to what, if anything, existed prior to this event.</p>

    <h3>Is the Big Bang theory universally accepted?</h3>
    <p>While the Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe, alternative theories exist. However, the overwhelming evidence supports the Big Bang model.</p>
