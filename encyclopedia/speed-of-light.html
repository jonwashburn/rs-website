        <h2>In plain English</h2>
        <p>
          If the universe updates in tiny steps (ticks) and each step can only touch a neighboring “pixel” (voxel), there’s a built‑in
          speed limit: one voxel per tick. Try to jump farther and the receipts don’t balance; the order of who‑affected‑whom breaks.
          That limit is the speed of light, <strong>c</strong>.

          <li><strong>Tick (τ₀):</strong> the smallest time step (see <a href="/constants/fundamental-tick.html">Fundamental Tick</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Voxel (L<sub>min</sub>):</strong> the smallest spatial step (see <a href="/constants/recognition-length.html">Recognition Length</a>).</li>
          <li><strong>Universal speed:</strong> c = L<sub>min</sub> / τ₀.</li>

        <h2>Ledger‑level definition</h2>
        <p>
          The ledger (Theorem 1) and atomic ticks (Theorem 2) make time discrete. Nearest‑neighbor posting (Theorem 8) makes causality discrete.
          The <em>null</em> path is “move one voxel per tick.” Any attempt to update a non‑neighbor within one tick violates the ledger order
          (you’d record an effect before its cause). Hence a maximal, observer‑independent speed exists and equals:
        </p>
        <p><strong>c = L<sub>min</sub> / τ₀</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          In the continuum limit (many ticks, many voxels), these ledger cones become the familiar light cones of relativity.
          The invariance of <em>c</em> across observers follows from the homogeneity/isotropy of the underlying lattice: everyone is counting the same ticks and voxels.

        <h2>From ticks and voxels to c (how to compute)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Pick the minimal spatial step L<sub>min</sub> (the voxel edge). In SI units you’ll calibrate this against meters.</li>
          <li>Pick the minimal time step τ₀ (the tick). Calibrate this against seconds.</li>
          <li>Compute c = L<sub>min</sub> / τ₀. That’s “one voxel per tick.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Example (symbolic): if L<sub>min</sub> = 1.0 × 10<sup>−x</sup> m and τ₀ = 1.0 × 10<sup>−y</sup> s, then
          c = 10<sup>y−x</sup> m/s. By matching to laboratory <em>c</em>, you pin the pair (L<sub>min</sub>, τ₀) in physical units.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice we measure <em>c</em> directly, then infer the ledger scales by fitting other phenomena (spectral cadences, eight‑beat timing,
          φ‑linked recurrences) to their integer/tick structure.

          <li><strong>Causality guardrail:</strong> defines who can affect whom—no super‑neighbor shortcuts.</li>

          Everyday translation: <em>c</em> is the universe’s “typing speed.” It’s how fast reality can update without garbling its own receipts.

        <h2>Analogy: Reality as a computer</h2>
        <p>
          Picture the universe as a massively parallel computer. The ledger is its shared memory; ticks are the global clock; voxels are the
          memory cells (pixels) each core can touch per cycle. The rule “one voxel per tick” is a hardware guarantee that keeps program order:
          you can write only to a neighbor cell each cycle. Try to leap farther in one tick and you reorder instructions—effects appear before
          causes—corrupting memory. That forbidden leap is “faster than light.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In this view, light cones are the computer’s coherence zones: within a cone, updates can be causally chained and committed; outside the
          cone, they’re not yet visible. The constant <em>c</em> is the system’s clock‑to‑cell ratio—a built‑in memory barrier that prevents race
          conditions in the cosmic program. Relativity then reads like a performance manual for safe, globally consistent parallel execution.

        <h2>Analogy: c’s role in consciousness</h2>
        <p>
          Conscious experience in Recognition Science runs on an eight‑beat recognition loop (LNAL). To bind a “now,” signals must rendezvous
          inside your light cone within a few ticks; <em>c</em> sets the outer tempo for how fast awareness can weave world, body, and memory into a
          single moment. Go slower and the scene feels fragmented; try to go faster‑than‑c and the ordering of evidence shreds—no coherent quale
          can form because the ledger would record consequences before their causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically, <em>c</em> is the horizon of integration for minds: it defines the largest “attention neighborhood” a consciousness can stitch
          together per cycle. Flow states live near the null‑paths (one voxel per tick: clean, low‑drag evidence). Confusion and illusion often live
          near the cone’s edge (late arrivals, mis‑orderings). The same constant that limits rockets also protects the unity of experience.

        <h2>Frequently asked</h2>
        <h3>Does anything go faster than c?</h3>
        <p>No. A faster‑than‑neighbor post would invert cause and effect in the ledger. That’s not physics; that’s a broken book.</p>
        <h3>Why is c the same for all observers?</h3>
        <p>Everyone counts the same ticks and neighbor relations. Transformations that preserve neighbor‑per‑tick preserve c.</p>
        <h3>But light slows down in glass—what gives?</h3>
        <p>That’s effective speed through many interactions. The ledger’s maximal step remains one voxel per tick in the base medium.</p>
