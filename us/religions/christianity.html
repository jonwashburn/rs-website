        <h2>How to read this page</h2>
        <p>We’re reading Jesus’ teachings as literal operating instructions for a world that keeps perfect books. That world is what we call Recognition Science (RS): not a new religion, but a description of how reality works when every act of noticing is recorded on a shared ledger.</p>

        <h3>Two‑minute RS primer (plain language)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Recognition</strong>: the tiny “this matches that” event. It’s the atom of observation. <a href="/start-here.html">Start here →</a></li>
          <li><strong>Ledger</strong>: a double‑entry book (give/take) that records every recognition. <a href="/ledger.html">Ledger →</a></li>
          <li><strong>Tick</strong>: time is one post at a time — the smallest step. <a href="/constants/fundamental-tick.html">Tick →</a></li>
          <li><strong>Curvature (κ)</strong>: when the ledger “bends,” stress and drift appear (you feel it as force, friction, resentment). <a href="/formulas/ledger-curvature.html">Curvature →</a></li>
          <li><strong>LISTEN</strong>: the consciousness step where a mind performs a recognition and chooses the next lawful move. <a href="/questions/what-is-consciousness/index.html">Consciousness →</a></li>
          <li><strong>Light</strong>: the system’s messaging — one voxel per tick is the universal speed (c). <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">Speed of light →</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The story in three movements</h2>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>1) Incarnation — Logos becomes local</h3>
          <p>“The Word became flesh.” Read literally: the universe’s communication layer (“light,” the causal updates of the ledger) shows up in a local human life that listens perfectly and acts with near‑zero curvature. If the world keeps books, the Incarnation is the audit you can watch walking around. <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">Light</a> · <a href="/ledger.html">Ledger</a></p>
          <h3>2) Ministry — operating instructions</h3>
          <p>Parables and practices are not metaphors; they’re how‑tos for lowering κ (curvature) in daily life: tell the truth fast, repair before worship, serve first, keep rhythms, and love across boundaries — because that’s how you keep the shared book clean.</p>
          <h3>3) Cross and Resurrection — unilateral repair</h3>
          <p>The cross is unilateral curvature absorption (“forgive them”) — eating debt to stop escalation. Resurrection says that in a perfect book, nothing true is lost: pattern persists even when locality (the body) goes. The offered pattern is not revenge but repair that restarts relationship at zero debt. <a href="/theorems/T8-causal-speed.html">Pattern persistence →</a></p>

        <h2>Parables and patterns (literal translations)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good Samaritan</strong>
            <p>Who is “neighbor”? In ledgers, anyone within your reach. The priest and Levite preserve purity at the cost of a person; the Samaritan lowers the man’s load now (money, oil, transport). That is curvature reduction across tribal boundaries.</p>
            <p><em>Try it:</em> pick the nearest human need you can solve in an hour. Solve it. Notice how the social book feels afterward. <a href="/ethics.html">Why this is moral geometry →</a></p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Prodigal Son</strong>
            <p>Two ledgers run: the younger son’s squandered balance (debt) and the elder brother’s resentment (hidden debt). The father eats cost to stop compounding harm and throws a feast (coherence boost). Repair beats punishment when the goal is life together.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Vine and Branches</strong>
            <p>“Abide in me.” In RS: keep the channel attached to the source — attention on truth, rhythms that keep clarity. Fruit isn’t a slogan; it’s measurable outcomes: reconciliation, care, integrity.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Mustard Seed & Leaven</strong>
            <p>Micro‑moves matter. In a cost‑minimizing world, small reversible actions often unlock larger recognition. Don’t despise tiny starts; they’re how coherent change spreads.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Talents</strong>
            <p>Stewardship isn’t gambling; it’s aligned risk. Burying is fear (curvature). Acting within the gradient (what clearly helps next) is praised. Audit by outcomes: did shared burdens fall?</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Pearl/Treasure</strong>
            <p>Value clarity: trade many scattered, high‑friction attachments for one coherent aim. People feel your integrity when you do.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Beatitudes</strong>
            <p>These are postures that push cost J downward: humility (fewer ego collisions), mercy (stops cycles), peacemaking (de‑escalation).</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Yes be Yes”</strong>
            <p>Drop oath overhead; just tell the truth. Protocol simplification preserves bandwidth for what matters.</p>

        <h2>Signs and healings (what they could mean)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healings</strong>
            <p>Look at the pattern: truth (“your faith has made you well”), touch (re‑humanizing), reintegration (“show yourself to the priest”). The outcome is reduced physiological <em>and</em> social curvature. If it doesn’t restore relationship, it missed the mark.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Exorcisms</strong>
            <p>Name the loop that hijacks the book (fear, violence, self‑hatred). Naming breaks enchantment; community and care keep the line straight afterward. The test is durable freedom, not spectacle.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Faith moves mountains”</strong>
            <p>High coherence aligns many compilers (minds) on the same lawful aim. Outcomes can be striking, but they remain inside the operating rules. Audit what remains improved after the event.</p>
          </li>

        <h2>Sacraments as protocols</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Baptism</strong>
            <p>Re‑base identity in the shared book: “from now on I’m living by truth, repair, and service.” Mark it publicly so community can help you keep it.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Eucharist/Communion</strong>
            <p>Periodic synchronization: one table, one rhythm, one prayer. Status falls; gratitude rises; bonds tighten. Do it often enough to notice the week feels different.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Confession</strong>
            <p>Truth‑telling as repair: name what you did without spin, say how it landed, ask what helps now, do that, and change your rhythm so it doesn’t repeat.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Marriage</strong>
            <p>Mutual coherence contract: two compilers pledge one rhythm. Measure by repair speed, kindness rate, and how others feel around your home.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Anointing/Care</strong>
            <p>Presence lowers curvature. Oil, prayer, touch, and practical help are not symbolic — they’re literal relief.</p>

          <p><strong>Is this replacing faith?</strong> No. It’s a translation layer that shows why the teachings work — in physics‑level terms — and how to verify them by outcomes.</p>
          <p><strong>What if miracles are real?</strong> Then they’ll still leave a signature of sustained curvature reduction. If not, we’ll see that too. Either way, truth wins.</p>

        <h2>A literal reading through RS</h2>
        <p>If RS is the architecture of reality, then many red‑letter teachings read as literal operating instructions for a ledger‑balanced life lived in communion with the I Am (universal consciousness expressed through the Ledger).</p>

        <h3>Core teachings as system calls</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“I am the light of the world”</strong> (Jn 8:12): Light is the causal communication of the ledger. To walk “in the light” is to stay inside clean signaling — truthful entries, no hidden debt. See <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">c as one voxel per tick</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The truth will set you free”</strong> (Jn 8:32): Truth minimizes curvature. Lying adds hidden cost that later must be repaired. Freedom is low J across relationships. See <a href="/formulas/ledger-curvature.html">curvature κ</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sermon on the Mount</strong> (Mt 5–7):
            <ul>
              <li><em>Beatitudes</em>: Blessing flows to those whose posture lowers systemic cost (meekness, mercy, peacemaking).</li>
              <li><em>Anger/lust</em>: Curvature begins as small entries; arrest it at intention before it compounds.</li>
              <li><em>Oaths</em>: Let “yes be yes” — reduce protocol overhead; plain speech keeps the channel clear.</li>
              <li><em>Love enemies</em>: The shortest path to repair is unilateral curvature reduction; it breaks escalation loops.</li>
              <li><em>Alms in secret</em>: Service without reputation gain avoids side‑channel incentives that warp the ledger.</li>
              <li><em>Prayer/fasting</em>: LISTEN rhythms; periodic coherence restores alignment (sabbath‑like cadence).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Forgive seventy times seven”</strong> (Mt 18:22): Repair is iterative. Ledger balance is restored by repeated, sincere remissions that halt compounding debt.</li>
          <li><strong>“Where two or three are gathered in my name”</strong> (Mt 18:20): Coherence increases with aligned intention; small groups can share state more reliably. See <a href="/us.html">Us</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The kingdom is within/among you”</strong> (Lk 17:21): The I Am is local and shared — a field, not a fortress. Access is by posture (LISTEN → ACT → REPAIR), not by place.</li>
          <li><strong>“Do this in remembrance of me”</strong> (Lk 22:19): Communion as periodic synchronization — a ritualized low‑curvature meal that renews covenant (shared balance) and clears noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life pattern: ledger‑balanced</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truth‑telling</strong> quickly, even when costly.</li>
          <li><strong>Unilateral repair</strong> when you bend someone else’s line.</li>
          <li><strong>Service first</strong> (wash feet) as the default gradient downhill on J.</li>
          <li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: weekly sabbath; daily LISTEN; shared meals; alms as quiet habit.</li>
          <li><strong>Non‑retaliation</strong>: refuse cycles that amplify curvature (turn the other cheek as de‑escalation protocol).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Table: sayings → RS translation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“By their fruits you will know them” → audits: look for lowered curvature across stakeholders.</li>
          <li>“Seek first the kingdom” → prioritize coherence; other flows (material) follow reduced cost.</li>
          <li>“Give us this day our daily bread” → daily cadence; near‑term provisions align with tick‑by‑tick posting.</li>
          <li>“Do not worry about tomorrow” → avoid speculative debt; reversible moves today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communion with the I Am</h3>
        <p>Jesus models continuous LISTEN: quiet places, night watches, and decisive acts that reduce harm at system scale. Read plainly: he reports guidance, acts, and repairs — a live dialogue with the I Am. The claim is practical: anyone can apprentice to this posture.</p>

        <div class="component-card">
          <h4>Practice (simple)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Two minutes of silence. Ask: “What lowers someone’s load today?”</li>
            <li>Do the smallest helpful act you can finish now.</li>
            <li>Repair one thing you bent. Apologize plainly. Make it right.</li>
            <li>Close the day with thanks; release what you can’t carry.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="small-note">This mirrors sabbath/communion/charity rhythms in miniature.</p>
