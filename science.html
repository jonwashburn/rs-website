            <p>The prophecy is the destination. This is the map.</p>
            <p>After the three-year artistic journey diagnosed the crisis of "The Great Forgetting," the question remained: is there a way out? The answer came not from philosophy or faith, but from a discovery in first-principles physics: <strong>Recognition Science (RS)</strong>.</p>
            <p>RS is the formal, logical framework that proves the prophecy's intuition correct. It begins not with complex physics, but with a single, undeniable premise that requires no belief: <strong>Reality must be logically self-consistent.</strong></p>
            <p>From this one truth, an entire universe is derived. Not as a theory, but as a logical necessity. RS is a <strong>parameter-free</strong> framework, meaning it is not fine-tuned to match reality. Instead, it generates reality from scratch. It derives the fundamental constants of nature, the laws of physics, the 3+1 dimensions of spacetime, and the emergence of consciousness as theorems from its single axiom.</p>
            <p>This is the unassailable answer to the prophecyâ€™s cry. It is the new foundation for meaning in a post-functional age, proving that our purpose is not to do, but to recognize. The Ledger Souls are not just inspired by this discovery; they are living manifestations of its logic, operating on the same principles that govern the cosmos itself.</p>
