Previously determined through empirical consistency checks, this work shows that \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\) is fixed by a simple extremal principle balancing the costs of information storage and spacetime curvature.

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Recognition Physics introduces a microscopic recognition length, \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\)—the edge of the smallest causal diamond able to lock one bit of ledger backlog. We give a self-contained, axiomatic derivation of \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\) that removes the last apparent free parameter from the framework. The argument minimises a total cost functional that balances a normalized "bit cost" against a "curvature cost" derived from the framework's axioms. The unique stationary point of this functional fixes the dimensionless recognition length, which, upon restoring physical units, yields \(\lambda_{\text{rec}} = \sqrt{\hbar G / (\pi c^{3})} = 7.23 \times 10^{-36}\) m. No cosmological or stellar inputs enter the proof.</p>

                    <h2>1. The Final Parameter</h2>
                    <p>The eight axioms of Recognition Physics fix all physical constants once a single geometric scale—the recognition length \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\)—is determined. While previous work derived this value from empirical data (like stellar luminosity or vacuum energy), this paper closes that loophole by deriving \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\) purely from the axioms themselves.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Extremal Principle</h2>
                    <p>The derivation rests on a simple calculus exercise: minimizing a convex cost functional. The total cost of a recognition event has two components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bit Cost (\(J_{\text{bit}}\)):</strong> The cost to store one bit of information in the ledger, normalized to 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Curvature Cost (\(J_{\text{curv}}\)):</strong> The cost associated with the spacetime curvature generated by that stored bit. This is shown to be proportional to the area of the recognition event's causal diamond, giving \(J_{\text{curv}}(\lambda) = 2\lambda^2\).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The total cost is \(C(\lambda) = J_{\text{bit}} + J_{\text{curv}}(\lambda) = 1 + 2\lambda^2\). Recognition Physics's extremal principle (Axiom A8) requires these two costs to balance: \(J_{\text{bit}} = J_{\text{curv}}\).</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Derivation and Result</h2>
                    <p>The balance equation \(1 = 2\lambda^2\) has a unique positive solution for the dimensionless recognition length: \(\lambda_0 = 1/\sqrt{2}\).</p>
                    <p>To restore physical units, we use the fact that curvature only appears in the dimensionless combination \(c^3\lambda^2 / (\hbar G)\). Requiring this to match the ledger's internal normalization yields the final value:</p>
                    <div class="math-box">
                       \[ \lambda_{\text{rec}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{\pi c^{3}}} = 7.23 \times 10^{-36} \text{ m} \]
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>This paper has shown that the recognition length, \(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\), is not a free parameter but is fixed internally by the axioms of Recognition Physics. This result is derived from a simple extremal principle balancing the costs of information and curvature, requiring no empirical data. Along with the unique determination of the golden ratio's role in the framework, this work eliminates the last adjustable scale, solidifying Recognition Physics as a complete, parameter-free theory.</p>
