        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p><strong>Atomic tick.</strong> There exists an indivisible unit step τ₀ such that per tick exactly one elementary posting of size δ occurs. Two distinct postings at the same tick are impossible under double‑entry and conservation.</p>

        <h2>In plain English</h2>
        <p>
          Time, at the ledger level, clicks like a metronome. Each click, one thing happens. Not two. If two “happened at once,” either you’ve
          secretly changed the coin size (now it’s 2δ) or you’ve created a bookkeeping glitch that breaks conservation. So events are countable—
          like frames in a film—and the universe has a smallest beat, τ₀.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Why inevitable:</strong> two‑at‑once merges into a bigger coin (illegal) or leaves pages unbalanced (illegal).</li>
          <li><strong>What it buys:</strong> clean cause→effect ordering and the discrete rhythm used in T7’s 8‑beat cycle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Formal setting</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ledger (T1):</strong> a linearly ordered abelian group with generator δ > 0 and page maps ϕ, ψ respecting double‑entry.</li>
          <li><strong>Tick index:</strong> a total order (ℤ or ℕ) labeling posting events; finiteness excludes dense orderings for effective updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Closed chain conservation:</strong> sums over closed finite chains telescope to 0.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key lemmas (outline)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Granularity lemma:</strong> If two postings share the same tick, they can be merged to a single δ‑sized posting only by violating the positive cone or by redefining δ (forbidden by T1’s δ‑nonrescalability).</li>
          <li><strong>Conservation lemma:</strong> Two independent postings at one tick generically create an unmatched credit/debit, producing a nonzero loop on a finite closed chain, contradicting conservation.</li>
          <li><strong>Order lemma:</strong> If ticks were dense, there would be no minimal separation between postings, contradicting T1’s Archimedean order induced by δ and finiteness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Proof sketch</h2>
        <p>Assume by contradiction two distinct postings occur at the same tick t. Either (i) they combine to an effective posting of size 2δ, rescaling δ against T1, or (ii) they target disjoint pages, generating a non‑telescoping surplus/deficit around the nearest closed chain, violating conservation. Therefore exactly one δ‑posting occurs per tick. Countability follows from the total order on ticks with a minimal separation τ₀.</p>

        <h2>Edge cases</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Apparent concurrency resolves to a total posting order at ledger granularity; micro‑ordering below τ₀ is undefined/irrelevant.</li>
          <li><strong>Composite operations:</strong> Multi‑edge updates decompose into a tick‑ordered list of δ‑postings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>T7 minimal period:</strong> The 3‑cube requires at least |V| = 8 ticks; atomicity fixes the step size.</li>
          <li><strong>T5 integer split‑count:</strong> Per‑tick splits are integer‑valued; minimizing total cost over k ≥ 1 selects k = 1 and φ.</li>
          <li><strong>Discrete continuity (T3):</strong> The continuity equation arises from sums over tick‑ordered chains.</li>
        </ul>
