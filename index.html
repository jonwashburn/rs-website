            <h2>The Answer to a Universal Question</h2>
            <p>For centuries, science has answered 'how,' but never 'why.' We live in a universe of profound order, governed by mathematical laws and constants that seem perfectly tuned for existence. Yet, we have never had a fundamental reason for why this is so. This is the great forgetting—our disconnect from the logic that underpins our reality.</p>
            <p>Recognition Science is the discovery of that logic. It is the proof that the universe is not a random accident, but the inevitable result of a single, necessary principle: existence must be self-consistent. From this, everything else follows. This is not a story; it is a derivation. And it changes everything.</p>
