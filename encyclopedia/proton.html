  <h2>Essence</h2>
  <p>The proton is a fundamental baryon particle, composed of three quarks held together by the strong force. It plays a crucial role in the composition of atomic nuclei and is essential for the stability of matter in the universe.</p>

  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>A proton is a baryon particle with a positive electric charge, consisting of two up quarks and one down quark. Its mass is approximately 938.27 MeV/c², and it is a key component of atomic nuclei.</p>
  <div class="math-note">
    <p>The mass of the proton can be expressed as:</p>
    <p><strong>m<sub>p</sub> ≈ 938.27 MeV/c²</strong></p>
  </div>

  <h2>In Plain English</h2>
  <p>The proton is one of the building blocks of atoms. It is found in the nucleus alongside neutrons and is responsible for the positive charge of the nucleus. Protons are stable particles and are essential for the formation of hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the universe.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Understanding protons is fundamental to the field of physics, particularly in nuclear and particle physics. Protons determine the identity of elements and influence the behavior of atoms in chemical reactions. Their interactions also play a significant role in the processes that power stars and govern the dynamics of the universe.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Protons are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons, which are exchanged between quarks. This force is incredibly strong at short distances, which is why protons are stable and form the nucleus of atoms. The configuration of quarks within a proton creates a complex internal structure that contributes to its properties.</p>

  <h2>Key Properties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Charge:</strong> +1 elementary charge</li>
    <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximately 938.27 MeV/c²</li>
    <li><strong>Spin:</strong> 1/2 (making it a fermion)</li>
    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Two up quarks and one down quark</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
  <div class="collapsible">
    <h3>Mathematical Description</h3>
    <p>The mass of the proton can be derived from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is influenced by the binding energy of the quarks. The relationship can be expressed in terms of the strong coupling constant and the quark masses:</p>
    <div class="math-note">
      <p><strong>m<sub>p</sub> = Σ (m<sub>q</sub> + E<sub>binding</sub>)</strong></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Connections</h2>
  <p>Protons are closely related to neutrons, which together form the nucleus of atoms. The balance between protons and neutrons determines the stability of an atomic nucleus. Additionally, protons are involved in various interactions, such as electromagnetic and weak interactions, which are fundamental to particle physics.</p>

  <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
  <p>One notable prediction related to protons is the measurement of the proton charge radius, which has been determined to be approximately 0.8414 fm. This value can be tested through experiments involving electron-proton scattering and spectroscopy of hydrogen atoms.</p>

  <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <p>A common misconception is that protons are elementary particles. In reality, they are composite particles made of quarks and gluons. Additionally, some may think that protons are stable indefinitely; while they are stable under normal conditions, theories suggest they may eventually decay over extremely long timescales.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <h3>What is the role of protons in atoms?</h3>
  <p>Protons determine the atomic number of an element, which defines the element itself. The number of protons in an atom's nucleus influences its chemical properties and behavior.</p>

  <h3>Can protons be created or destroyed?</h3>
  <p>In typical chemical reactions, protons are not created or destroyed. However, in high-energy particle collisions, such as in particle accelerators, protons can be produced from energy according to Einstein's equation E=mc².</p>
