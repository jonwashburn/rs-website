A comprehensive presentation of Recognition Physics theory - the unified framework that derives all physics, mathematics, biology, and consciousness from a single meta-principle: "Nothing cannot recognize itself."

## Theory Overview

Recognition Physics achieves what physics has long sought: a complete, parameter-free derivation of reality from logical necessity. Starting from the impossibility of self-recognition by nothingness, the theory derives:

- **Eight Foundations**: Discrete time, dual balance, positive cost, unitary evolution, irreducible tick, spatial voxels, eight-beat closure, and the golden ratio
- **Physical Constants**: All emerge mathematically (φ, E_coh = 0.090 eV, τ₀ = 7.33 fs)
- **Particle Masses**: 85+ predictions with <1% error using the φ-ladder
- **Consciousness**: Emerges at rung 45 through qualia navigation of undecidability gaps
- **Mathematics**: Unified solutions to P vs NP, Riemann Hypothesis, and more

## Website Structure

- `index.html` - Main overview and introduction
- `foundations.html` - The eight foundational principles
- `pattern-layer.html` - Timeless substrate and consciousness emergence
- `predictions.html` - Physical and mathematical predictions
- `lean-proofs.html` - Formal verification details
- `resources.html` - Papers, code, and additional materials

## Technical Details

The theory is formally verified in Lean 4 with zero axioms and zero sorry statements. All proofs derive from type theory alone.
