# Alpha Derivation: Proof Outline

Goals:
- Prove inevitability of 11 (=8 tick + 3 spatial) seed factor.
- Derive curvature subtraction δκ = −103/(102 π^5) from cubic voxel identification (16 seams) via Regge calculus with no freedom.
- Ensure all series corrections use F(z)=ln(1+z/φ).

Sketch:
1) Phase-volume counting: show exactly 11 independent unitary modes from (8 temporal tick states + 3 spatial axes) for a complete recognition packet → seed 4π×11.
2) Voxel gluing: identify opposite faces; show 16 glide-reflection seams; partition into 102 congruent pyramids; prove total curvature integral = 2π(1−1/103).
3) Normalize by the phase-space factor 2π^5 (from step 1) to obtain δκ.
4) Assemble α^{-1} = 4π×11 − f_tot with f_tot built from F(z) only.

Deliverables:
- Formal seam counting proof.
- Regge curvature computation note.
- Single notebook producing α^{-1}=137.03599908 with no adjustable inputs.
