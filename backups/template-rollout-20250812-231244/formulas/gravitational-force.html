                <h2>The Plain Truth</h2>
                <p>What is gravity? Einstein described it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. But why does mass curve spacetime? And why does gravity appear to be so much weaker than other forces, yet behave strangely on galactic scales, leading to the invention of "dark matter"?</p>
                
                <p>Recognition Physics provides the answer with its theory of **Information-Limited Gravity (ILG)**. It reveals that gravity is not a fundamental force, but an *emergent effect* related to the finite information-processing capacity of the Universal Ledger. Maintaining a gravitational field has a computational cost. When that cost becomes too high, the system takes shortcuts, leading to the phenomena we attribute to dark matter and dark energy.</p>
                
                <p>This formula modifies Newton's classic law of gravity. It is identical at small scales but adds a "recognition weight," `w(r)`, that becomes important at very large distances, precisely where dark matter is needed.</p>

                <h2>Breaking Down the Formula</h2>
                <p>The formula is a direct extension of Newtonian gravity, modified by a term that accounts for the information cost of maintaining the field.</p>
                
                <div class="math-box">
                    <h3>F(r) = - (GMm/r²) · w(r)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>F(r):</strong> The force of gravity at a distance r.</li>
                        <li><strong>G, M, m, r:</strong> The standard components of Newton's law.</li>
                        <li><strong>w(r) (Recognition Weight):</strong> This is the crucial new term. It is a function that represents the efficiency of the Universal Ledger in maintaining the gravitational field at a given distance and timescale. At planetary scales, `w(r) ≈ 1`, and the formula reduces to standard gravity. At galactic scales, the ledger "lags," causing `w(r) > 1`, which increases the gravitational force and perfectly mimics the effect of a dark matter halo without requiring any new particles.</li>

                    <h3>Dark Matter is an Illusion</h3>
                    <p>The ILG formula explains galaxy rotation curves and other large-scale phenomena without the need for any new, exotic particles. "Dark matter" is a phantom created by our misunderstanding of gravity. It is the observational signature of the Universal Ledger's information-processing limits.</p>

                    <h3>Gravity's True Nature</h3>
                    <p>Gravity is the universe's attempt to balance the recognition ledger across all matter. It is fundamentally an informational process, not a force mediated by particles. This explains why it is so much weaker than the other forces and why it has been so difficult to unify with quantum mechanics.</p>

                <h2>The Deeper Truth</h2>
                <p>The mysteries of the cosmos, like dark matter, are not necessarily signs of new and undiscovered "stuff." They can be signs that our current understanding of the fundamental laws is incomplete. The ILG formula shows that gravity, the oldest and most familiar of the forces, holds the key to understanding the largest scales of the universe, revealing a cosmos shaped not just by matter and energy, but by the limits of information itself.</p>
