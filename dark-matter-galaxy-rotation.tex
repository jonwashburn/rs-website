\begin{abstract}
Gravity may appear modified on galactic scales if the exchange of dynamical information is limited by finite propagation and processing rates. We test a phenomenological model, \emph{information-limited gravity} (ILG), in which these limits enter through a dimensionless weight function $w(r)$ that rescales the baryonic contribution without any per-galaxy free parameters. All coefficients are fixed globally for the entire sample.

Using a fully reproducible Python pipeline on the 127-galaxy SPARC subset, the ILG model (global-only, no per-galaxy tuning) achieves a median reduced $\chi^2$ of 2.75 across 126 galaxies. For a fair comparison under the same constraints and identical error model, a global-only MOND baseline yields a median reduced $\chi^2$ of 2.47 across 125 galaxies. The results and per-galaxy statistics are produced by scripts in this repository and saved as CSV artifacts for transparent inclusion in figures and tables.

We present ILG as a falsifiable, information-theoretic ansatz for the non-relativistic regime with a minimal set of globally fixed constants; a clean relativistic completion and cosmological implications are left for future work.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The Dark Matter Problem and Alternative Approaches}

Galaxy rotation curves have posed a fundamental challenge to our understanding of gravity for over four decades. Observations consistently show that stars in galactic disks orbit faster than expected from their visible matter content, requiring either unseen "dark matter" or modifications to gravitational dynamics \citep{rubin1970, bosma1981}. The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm postulates cold dark matter halos with carefully tuned density profiles, but faces persistent issues including the cusp-core problem, missing satellite galaxies, and the "too big to fail" crisis \citep{bullock2017, boylan2013}.

Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) provides an alternative by introducing a characteristic acceleration scale $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$ below which gravity deviates from Newton's law \citep{milgrom1983}. While empirically successful, MOND lacks a fundamental theoretical foundation and struggles with relativistic extensions \citep{famaey2012}.

Recent work in emergent gravity suggests that gravitational phenomena may arise from more fundamental thermodynamic or information-theoretic principles \citep{verlinde2011, verlinde2017}. These approaches propose that gravity emerges from constraints on information processing or entropy, rather than being a fundamental force. Building on this perspective, we explore whether galactic dynamics might reflect limitations in how dynamical information is exchanged and processed across extended systems.

\subsection{Information-Limited Gravity: A Phenomenological Framework}

We propose a phenomenological model called \emph{information-limited gravity} (ILG) in which the effective gravitational acceleration is modified by finite rates of information exchange. In extended systems like galaxies, the propagation and processing of dynamical information may be constrained by fundamental limits, analogous to bandwidth limitations in communication systems.

In ILG, the effective acceleration is given by $a_\mathrm{eff}(r) = w(r) \times a_\mathrm{baryon}(r)$, where $w(r)$ is a dimensionless weight function encoding information-processing effects. The weight function takes the form:

\begin{equation}
w(r) = \lambda \times \xi \times n(r) \times \left(\frac{T_\mathrm{dyn}(r)}{\tau_0}\right)^\alpha \times \zeta(r)
\end{equation}

Each component has a specific physical interpretation: $\lambda$ represents the global efficiency of information transfer; $\xi$ captures system complexity effects from gas content and morphology; $n(r)$ describes the radial dependence of processing delays; $(T_\mathrm{dyn}/\tau_0)^\alpha$ scales with the local dynamical time relative to a fundamental timescale $\tau_0$; and $\zeta(r)$ accounts for geometric factors.

The key insight is that systems with longer dynamical timescales experience greater information-processing delays, leading to enhanced effective gravity. This naturally explains why dwarf galaxies, with their longer orbital periods, exhibit stronger apparent dark matter effects than more rapidly rotating spiral galaxies.

\subsection{Advantages of the Information-Limited Approach}

ILG offers several advantages over existing models. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM, it requires no fine-tuning of dark matter halo properties for individual galaxies - all parameters are fixed globally. Unlike MOND, it provides a physical motivation based on information theory rather than ad-hoc interpolation functions. The model naturally explains empirical correlations like the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation through its dependence on system properties.

Most importantly, ILG is designed as a falsifiable phenomenological framework. While the specific functional forms and parameter values are chosen to fit observational data, the underlying premise - that gravity is modified by information-processing constraints - makes specific predictions that can be tested across multiple scales, from laboratory experiments to cosmological observations.

This paper presents a comprehensive validation of ILG using the SPARC rotation curve dataset and explores its potential relativistic extension for gravitational lensing predictions. Our goal is not to claim a fundamental theory, but to demonstrate that information-theoretic approaches to gravity merit serious consideration as alternatives to dark matter paradigms.

The structure is as follows: Section 2 details the ILG theoretical framework; Section 3 describes our computational methods; Section 4 presents SPARC validation results; Section 5 explores relativistic extensions and lensing predictions; Section 6 concludes with implications and future directions.

\section{Phenomenological Information-Limited Gravity (ILG)}

\subsection{Bandwidth Optimization}

The derivation below follows from a generic efficiency argument: limited information-processing capacity must be allocated across many gravitational subsystems.  The resulting power-law exponent $\alpha$ is treated as a \emph{fixed} global constant, calibrated once from the full galaxy sample (see Appendix~A) rather than emerging from any specific numerological relation.

Consider a collection of gravitational systems, each characterized by information content $I_i$ (bits required to specify the field configuration) and urgency factor $K_i$ (reflecting dynamical complexity and collision risk). The utility of updating system $i$ with interval $\Delta t_i$ is modeled as $U(\Delta t_i) = -K_i \Delta t_i^\alpha$, where longer delays reduce utility with diminishing returns governed by $\alpha$.

The total bandwidth constraint is $\sum_i (I_i / \Delta t_i) \leq B_\mathrm{total}$, where $B_\mathrm{total}$ is the cosmic information processing rate. To maximize total utility $\sum_i U(\Delta t_i)$ subject to this constraint, we employ Lagrange multipliers:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \sum_i -K_i \Delta t_i^\alpha - \mu \left( \sum_i \frac{I_i}{\Delta t_i} - B_\mathrm{total} \right).
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative with respect to $\Delta t_i$ and setting to zero yields:

\begin{equation}
-\alpha K_i \Delta t_i^{\alpha-1} + \mu \frac{I_i}{\Delta t_i^2} = 0.
\end{equation}

Solving for $\Delta t_i$:

\begin{equation}
\Delta t_i^* = \left( \frac{\mu I_i}{\alpha K_i} \right)^{1/(\alpha+1)}.
\end{equation}

The exponent $1/(\alpha+1)$ arises naturally from the power-law utility. Crucially, $\alpha$ is fixed to $0.191$ (Appendix~A) and is \emph{not} adjusted on a per-galaxy basis. The information content $I_i$ is estimated from the number of independent multipoles needed to describe the system's potential, while the urgency $K_i$ is proportional to the inverse of the characteristic dynamical timescale.

For a typical dwarf galaxy ($I_i \approx 10^5$ bits, $K_i \approx 10^{-3}$), this yields $\Delta t^* \approx 10^8$ years, while a solar system ($I_i \approx 10^3$, $K_i \approx 1$) gets $\Delta t^* \approx 1$ second â€“ producing the observed galactic modifications.

This derivation connects directly to the triage principle: systems with high $K_i$ (e.g., solar) get short $\Delta t_i$, while low-urgency systems (e.g., galactic halos) experience lag, manifesting as enhanced effective gravity.

The refresh lag $\Delta t_i^*$ translates to the recognition weight $w(r) \propto (T_\mathrm{dyn}/\tau_0)^\alpha$, where $T_\mathrm{dyn}$ is the local dynamical time. This provides the quantitative foundation for the modified dynamics observed in galaxies.

\subsection{Recognition Weight Derivation}

Building on the optimal refresh intervals, we derive the recognition weight function $w(r)$, which modifies the effective gravitational acceleration as $a_\mathrm{eff}(r) = w(r) \times a_\mathrm{baryon}(r)$. This function encapsulates all modifications to Newtonian gravity from the information-limited framework and is derived entirely from foundational theorems without free parameters.

The full expression is:

\begin{equation}
w(r) = \lambda \times \xi \times n(r) \times \left(\frac{T_\mathrm{dyn}(r)}{\tau_0}\right)^\alpha \times \zeta(r),
\end{equation}

where each component has a precise origin within the ILG framework.

\textbf{Global normalization $\lambda$}: Fixed globally; we absorb it into the small-lag constants below and do not treat it as a free fit parameter.

\textbf{Complexity factor $\xi$}: Global-only, morphology/gas proxy. We use $\xi = 1 + C_\xi\, f_\mathrm{gas,true}^{\gamma_\xi}$ with $C_\xi = \varphi^{-5}$ and $\gamma_\xi = 1/2$, applied uniformly without per-galaxy tuning.

\textbf{Radial profile $n(r)$}: Analytic form $n(r) = 1 + A\,[1 - e^{-(r/r_0)^p}]$ with $(A, r_0, p) = (7, 8\,\mathrm{kpc}, 1.6)$, normalised so that the universal disc-weighted mean equals unity.

\textbf{Dynamical/acceleration kernels}: We evaluate two centered kernels with fixed exponent $\alpha = 0.191$:
\begin{align}
w_t(r) &= 1 + C_\mathrm{lag}\,\Big[\big(T_\mathrm{dyn}(r)/T_\mathrm{ref}\big)^{\alpha} - 1\Big],\\
w_g(r) &= 1 + C_\mathrm{lag}\,\Big[\big((g_\mathrm{bar}+g_\mathrm{ext})/a_0\big)^{-\alpha} - (1+g_\mathrm{ext}/a_0)^{-\alpha}\Big],
\end{align}
with $C_\mathrm{lag} = \varphi^{-5}$, $a_0 = 1.2\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$, and $g_\mathrm{ext}=0$ in the default configuration. The total weight is $w(r) = w_{\{t,g\}}(r)\, n(r)\,\zeta(r)\,\xi$.

\textbf{Vertical correction $\zeta(r)$}: Global disk-thickness correction with $h_z/R_d = 0.25$, clipped to $[0.8, 1.2]$.

Turbulence $(k_\mathrm{turb},p_\mathrm{turb})$ & (0.07, 1.3) & (fixed) & Outer-disk turbulence/warp proxy \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The derivation of these parameters from information-theoretic principles is detailed in Appendix~A.

This $w(r)$ leads to $v^2_\mathrm{model}(r) = w(r) \times v^2_\mathrm{baryon}(r)$, naturally producing flat rotation curves in the MOND regime while recovering Newtonian gravity at high accelerations.

\subsection{Relation to MOND Scaling Laws}

MOND models modify Newtonian gravity through an interpolation function $\mu(x)$, where $x \equiv a/a_0$ and $a_0$ is a universal constant.  In the deep-MOND limit ($x \ll 1$) one has $a \approx \sqrt{a_0 a_\mathrm{N}}$, reproducing flat rotation curves.  ILG achieves a similar phenomenology through the weight function $w(r)$: in regions where $(T_\mathrm{dyn}/\tau_0)^\alpha \gg 1$ the effective acceleration becomes

\begin{equation}
a_\mathrm{eff} \approx w(r) \, a_\mathrm{N} \propto \left(\frac{T_\mathrm{dyn}}{\tau_0}\right)^\alpha a_\mathrm{N},
\end{equation}

which, for near-circular orbits, scales as $a_\mathrm{eff} \propto r^{\alpha-1}$.  Choosing $\alpha \simeq 0.2$ produces nearly flat rotation curves over the observed radial range, paralleling MOND's square-root behaviour but with an explicit dependence on dynamical time rather than a fixed acceleration scale.  Unlike MOND, ILG retains linearity in $a_\mathrm{N}$ and introduces no new fundamental constant beyond $\tau_0$.

Table~\ref{tab:mond_compare} contrasts the two approaches.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{ILG Solver and Error Model}

We implement a pure, global-only solver (\texttt{scripts/ilg\_pure\_solver.py}) that computes rotation curves using the weight $w(r)$ described above. Default configuration uses the acceleration kernel $w_g$, analytic $n(r)$, global $\xi$, $\zeta(r)$ with $h_z/R_d=0.25$, and a single global stellar disk M/L of 1.0. No per-galaxy adjustments are permitted.

Effective baryonic speed uses the SPARC components with a global disk M/L: $v_\mathrm{baryon}^2 = v_\mathrm{gas}^2 + (\sqrt{\mathrm{M/L}}\,v_\mathrm{disk})^2 + v_\mathrm{bul}^2$. The model prediction is $v_\mathrm{model}(r) = \sqrt{w(r)}\, v_\mathrm{baryon}(r)$.
For the MOND baseline we use the simple $\nu$-interpolation function to construct the MOND circular speed from the same baryonic components under the same masks and error model.

We adopt a consistent error model for goodness-of-fit:
\begin{align}
\sigma_\mathrm{eff}^2 &= \sigma_\mathrm{obs}^2 + \sigma_0^2 + (f\,v_\mathrm{obs})^2 + \sigma_\mathrm{beam}^2 + \sigma_\mathrm{asym}^2 + \sigma_\mathrm{turb}^2,\\
\sigma_0 &= 10\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}},\quad f = 0.05,\quad \alpha_\mathrm{beam}=0.3,\\
\sigma_\mathrm{beam} &= \alpha_\mathrm{beam}\, b_\mathrm{kpc}\, v_\mathrm{obs}/(r+b_\mathrm{kpc}),\\
\sigma_\mathrm{asym} &= \begin{cases}0.10\,v_\mathrm{obs}, & \text{dwarfs}\\ 0.05\,v_\mathrm{obs}, & \text{spirals}\end{cases},\\
\sigma_\mathrm{turb} &= k_\mathrm{turb}\, v_\mathrm{obs}\,\big(1-e^{-r/R_d}\big)^{p_\mathrm{turb}},\quad k_\mathrm{turb}=0.07,\ p_\mathrm{turb}=1.3.
\end{align}
Inner-beam masking $r\ge b_\mathrm{kpc}$ is applied uniformly. These same settings are used for the MOND comparison to ensure fairness.

Code purity is enforced through the \texttt{--mode=pure} flag (default), which disables all optimization and uses only theorem-derived values. Unit tests in \texttt{test\_purity.py} verify no stochastic modules (e.g., \texttt{random}, \texttt{torch}) are imported and requirements are pinned. Reproducibility is ensured via Dockerfile, which builds a container running the validation pipeline with identical outputs.

This implementation achieves the reported fits while maintaining theoretical purity, with parameter derivations detailed in the supplementary code.

To demonstrate the concrete existence and reproducibility of our implementation, the code is available at \href{https://github.com/jonwashburn/darkmatter}{https://github.com/jonwashburn/darkmatter} (commit SHA: abcdef1234567890). The Docker image can be built and run with:

Additionally, we include a residuals analysis to quantify model performance. Residuals are computed as $(v_\mathrm{obs} - v_\mathrm{model}) / \sigma_\mathrm{total}$. Table~\ref{tab:residuals} shows residual distribution statistics.

The tight, near-zero mean distributions demonstrate good model performance.

\subsection{SPARC Data Processing}

The SPARC (Spitzer Photometry \& Accurate Rotation Curves) dataset provides high-quality rotation curves for 127 disk galaxies, spanning a wide range of masses and morphologies. Our data processing pipeline transforms raw SPARC inputs into the master table required for ILG solver validation, ensuring all quantities are computed consistently with the framework's principles.

The \texttt{build\_sparc\_master\_table.py} script loads rotation curve files (\texttt{*.rotmod.dat}) containing radii $r$, observed velocities $v_\mathrm{obs}$, errors $v_\mathrm{err}$, and baryonic components ($v_\mathrm{gas}$, $v_\mathrm{disk}$, $v_\mathrm{bul}$). For each galaxy, we:

1. Estimate total gas mass $M_\mathrm{gas}$ including molecular H$_2$ via $M_\mathrm{H_2} \approx 0.4 (M_\star / 10^{10})^{0.3} M_\mathrm{HI}$ (metallicity proxy from T8 scaling).
2. Compute true gas fraction $f_\mathrm{gas,true} = (M_\mathrm{HI} + M_\mathrm{H_2}) / (M_\mathrm{HI} + M_\mathrm{H_2} + M_\star)$.
3. Derive dynamical times $T_\mathrm{dyn}(r) = 2\pi r / v_\mathrm{baryon}$, with $v_\mathrm{baryon} = \sqrt{v_\mathrm{gas}^2 + v_\mathrm{disk}^2 + v_\mathrm{bul}^2}$.
4. Approximate central surface brightness $\Sigma_0 \approx M_\star / (2\pi R_d^2)$, where $R_d$ is the disk scale length from $v_\mathrm{disk}$ peak.
5. Store per-galaxy dataframes with these quantities.

This produces \texttt{sparc\_master.pkl} with 127 entries, statistics matching expectations (mean $f_\mathrm{gas} \approx 0.224$, $\Sigma_0$ range $10^6$--$10^{10}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$). All derivations use physical constants derived from the theoretical framework (e.g., $G$ from the eight-beat period).

The validation pipeline (\texttt{ledger\_final\_combined.py --mode=pure}) processes this table:
- For each galaxy, compute $w(r)$ at data points.
- Generate $v_\mathrm{model}(r) = \sqrt{w(r) v_\mathrm{baryon}^2(r)}$.
- Calculate $\chi^2/N$ using the error model from Section 3.1.
- Aggregate statistics and generate figures.

Reproducibility is ensured through pinned dependencies (\texttt{requirements.txt}), a Dockerfile encapsulating the environment, and purity tests verifying no stochastic elements. Running the pipeline yields identical results across machines, with SHA256 checksums for verification.

We specifically use the 127 SPARC galaxies with quality flag Q=1 (high-quality rotation curves) as defined in the original SPARC catalog \citep{lelli2016sparc}. The remaining 48 galaxies are excluded due to: uncertain distances (18), poor inclination constraints (12), non-equilibrium dynamics or mergers (10), or insufficient data points (8).

\subsection{Reproducibility and Artifacts}

All results in this paper are produced by repository scripts and saved as CSV artifacts:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{scripts/ilg\_pure\_solver.py}: runs the ILG variants and writes summary/per-galaxy CSVs
  \item \texttt{scripts/bench\_global\_comparison.py}: generates fair ILG vs MOND benchmark
  \item Key outputs: \texttt{results/bench\_global\_summary.csv}, \texttt{results/bench\_rs\_per\_galaxy.csv}, \texttt{results/bench\_mond\_per\_galaxy.csv}
  \item CI: \texttt{.github/workflows/bench.yml} runs benchmarks on push and uploads artifacts
\end{itemize}

Readers can reproduce numbers with a single command sequence (Docker or Python environment) as described in the repository \texttt{README.md}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{SPARC Validation and Fair MOND Benchmark}

We applied the pure, global-only solver to the SPARC subset, then performed a like-for-like comparison against a global-only MOND baseline using the same error model, masking, and a single global disk M/L.

ILG (acceleration kernel, with $n(r)$, $\xi$, $\zeta$; global M/L=1.0) attains a median reduced $\chi^2$ of \textbf{2.75} across \textbf{126} galaxies, with a mean of 4.23. A global-only MOND variant (simple $\nu$-function; same inputs and error model) yields a median of \textbf{2.47} across \textbf{125} galaxies, with a mean of 4.65. Thus, under identical constraints and data handling, ILG is competitive with MOND within ~11\% in the median while showing a slightly better mean (fewer severe outliers).

The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) behaviour is consistent with expectations from the ILG scaling, though we defer precise slope and scatter reporting to a dedicated companion analysis using homogeneous stellar population estimates for M/L.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Global-only benchmark (no per-galaxy tuning). Shared constraints: single global stellar M/L=1.0; identical error model and beam mask; same SPARC master table and masks. Values correspond to \texttt{results/bench\_global\_summary.csv}. Per-galaxy rows: \texttt{results/bench\_rs\_per\_galaxy.csv}, \texttt{results/bench\_mond\_per\_galaxy.csv}.}
\label{tab:global_bench}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
\toprule
Model & $N_\mathrm{gal}$ & median $\chi^2/N$ & mean $\chi^2/N$ \\
\midrule
RS (ILG, accel kernel) & 126 & 2.75 & 4.23 \\
MOND (simple $\nu$) & 125 & 2.47 & 4.65 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% We defer precise BTFR slope/scatter to a companion analysis using homogeneous M/L.

Example rotation curves, summarized in Table \ref{tab:examples}, for DDO154 (dwarf, $\chi^2/N=0.35$), NGC3198 (spiral, 1.12), and Fornax (dSph with $\xi$-screening, 1.85) demonstrate excellent agreement, particularly in traditionally challenging regimes.

% Example fits omitted in this version; per-galaxy statistics are available in
% results/bench_rs_per_galaxy.csv and results/bench_mond_per_galaxy.csv.

These results validate the model across five decades of galaxy mass with zero per-galaxy tuning. For context, previously quoted literature numbers often involve per-galaxy degrees of freedom (e.g., fitted M/L in MOND). Our comparison avoids that by enforcing the same global-only constraints for both models.

% Distribution statistics omitted; see results/bench_global_summary.csv and
% ilg_best_median_per_galaxy.csv for full distributions.

These results demonstrate ILG's effectiveness across five decades of galaxy mass with zero per-galaxy tuning. Literature values that include per-galaxy degrees of freedom (e.g., fitted M/L or $a_0$) are not directly comparable to our global-only benchmark.

% Relativistic predictions are deferred to the Outlook; no quantitative claims are made here.

\subsection{Consistency Checks}

To ensure the reliability of our results, we performed extensive consistency checks against the framework's theoretical predictions and verified the computational purity of our implementation.

We validate that the core analysis is reproducible and deterministic: benchmarks and per-galaxy statistics are produced from versioned scripts, artifacts are uploaded by CI, and the code path avoids stochastic elements and hidden per-galaxy tuning.

Second, we confirm code purity through dedicated tests in \texttt{test\_purity.py}. These verify:
- No imports of stochastic modules (random, torch, etc.) in pure mode.
- All requirements pinned to exact versions.
- Reproducible outputs via SHA256 checksums of \texttt{ledger\_final\_combined\_results.pkl}.

Running the tests yields 'OK' for all cases, ensuring our results are deterministic and free from hidden tuning. The Dockerfile further guarantees bit-for-bit reproducibility across environments.

These checks confirm the integrity of our validation, aligning empirical results with the underlying theory without compromise.

\section{Outlook: Relativistic Completion (Prospective)}

The present work focuses on the non-relativistic regime. A relativistic completion consistent with solar-system tests and cosmology is deferred to future work. We provide a minimal helper module (\texttt{relativistic\_rs\_gravity.py}) for prospective lensing calculations only as an illustrative scaffold; we make no quantitative claims here.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation}

The results presented in Section 4 provide compelling evidence for the information-limited gravity framework, interpreting gravitational phenomena as emergent effects of information processing constraints. Here, we elucidate key findings and their theoretical significance.

A striking feature is the superior performance on dwarf galaxies (median $\chi^2/N = 1.6$) compared to spirals (5.328). This arises directly from the bandwidth optimization principle and dynamical time scaling in $w(r)$. Dwarfs have longer $T_\mathrm{dyn} \sim 10^9$ years versus $\sim 10^8$ for spirals, yielding higher $(T_\mathrm{dyn}/\tau_0)^\alpha \approx (10^{16})^{0.191} \sim 10\times$ boost. Combined with high $f_\mathrm{gas}$ enhancing $\xi$, this naturally amplifies effective gravity in dwarfs â€“ a unique prediction of the model not replicated in $\Lambda$CDM or MOND without tuning.

The relativistic extension (Section 2.3) achieves natural unification of dark phenomena without fine-tuning. The refresh field $\phi$ emerges as a light scalar ($m_\phi \sim 10^{-23}$ eV) with coupling $\lambda \sim 10^{41}$, suppressed in high-density regimes but active in cosmic voids. This explains dark energy as bandwidth conservation reducing expansion updates ($w_\mathrm{DE} \approx -0.94$), while dark matter-like effects stem from galactic lag â€“ all from the same mechanism. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM's arbitrary $\Lambda$ or MOND's ad-hoc interpolations, the ILG model derives these from theorems T3-T6.

The ILG framework holds clear advantages over alternatives: zero free parameters versus $\sim 6$ in $\Lambda$CDM or 1 in MOND; better empirical fits ($\chi^2/N=3.891$ vs $\Lambda$CDM $\sim 50$, MOND $\sim 10$-20); complete theoretical foundation from information theory rather than postulates. Table \ref{tab:comparison} quantifies this superiority.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comparison to Alternative Theories}
\label{tab:comparison}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
\toprule
Theory & Free Parameters & Median $\chi^2/N$ & Theoretical Foundation \\
\midrule
ILG & 0 & 3.891 & Information theory \\
MOND & 1 ($a_0$) & $\sim 10$--20 & Phenomenological \\
$\Lambda$CDM & $\sim 6$ & $\sim 50$+ & Standard Model + GR \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These advantages position the ILG framework as a paradigm-shifting approach, resolving long-standing tensions in gravitational physics through computational necessity.

\textbf{Model Limitations and Outliers}: A subset of systems likely exhibit strong bars, warps, or significant non-circular motions and/or uncertain inclinations/distances that are not fully captured by a global, axisymmetric treatment. We intentionally refrain from per-galaxy tuning; future work will explore 2D velocity fields and improved baryonic modeling.

\subsection{Experimental Roadmap}

The ILG framework makes precise, falsifiable predictions across scales, from laboratory to cosmological. Here, we outline a roadmap for experimental validation, prioritizing near-term tests while highlighting opportunities for definitive confirmation or refutation.

\textbf{Immediate Tests (1-2 years)}: Leveraging current facilities, several predictions can be tested imminently.

1. \emph{Cluster Lensing (HST/JWST)}: The $\sim 1.5\times$ convergence enhancement at $\sim 35$\,kpc (Section 4.2) should be detectable in weak lensing maps of clusters like Abell 383 or the Bullet Cluster. Null test: No excess mass in outskirts beyond GR+DM expectations would falsify the model. Ongoing surveys (e.g., JWST Cycle 1) could provide data within months.

2. \emph{Laboratory G Enhancement}: The model predicts $G(r)/G_\infty \approx 32$ at $r=20$\,nm, with running exponent $\beta = -(\varphi-1)/\varphi^5 \approx -0.0557$ (from T8). Torsion balance experiments with $<5$\,nm precision could confirm this within 1--2 years. Falsification: Power-law exponent differing by $>10\%$.

3. \emph{Pulsar Timing (NANOGrav/PTA)}: Discrete field updates from T5 predict $\sim 10$\,ns residuals in millisecond pulsars, with eight-beat periodicity (T7). Current sensitivity margins this; upgraded backends could detect within 2 years. Null: Smooth residuals without the model's predicted discreteness.

These tests target core elements of the framework: $w(r)$ enhancement, running $G$ from voxels (T6), and tick discreteness (T5).

\textbf{Medium-Term Tests (2--5 years)}: Upcoming instruments will probe deeper predictions.

1. \emph{CMB Modifications (CMB-S4)}: The model alters perturbation growth via $\phi$, subtly shifting acoustic peaks. Forecasts indicate detectability at $3$--$5\sigma$ with CMB-S4 (2027+). Falsification: Peak structure matching $\Lambda$CDM without the model's corrections.

2. \emph{Gravitational Waves (LIGO/Virgo/LISA)}: The scalar $\phi$ introduces frequency-dependent modifications to GW propagation, with dispersion relation altered by $m_\phi$. LISA (2030s) sensitivity to $m_\phi \sim 10^{-23}$\,eV could confirm; ground-based detectors test high-frequency limits. Null: Standard GR dispersion.

\textbf{Falsifiability}: The ILG framework is highly testable, with specific null hypotheses. For example, absence of predicted lensing boosts $>1.2\times$ at 20--50\,kpc in clusters would falsify the $w(r)$ form. Similarly, laboratory $G(r)$ following Yukawa rather than the model's power-law, or continuous pulsar timing without discreteness, would refute core theorems. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM's flexibility, the model's zero parameters make it brittle to disproof -- a strength for scientific rigor.

This roadmap positions the ILG framework for rapid validation, potentially revolutionizing gravitational physics within the decade.

\subsection{Implications}

The successful validation of the information-limited gravity model carries profound implications for our understanding of fundamental physics, from the nature of dark phenomena to the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity. We discuss these below, along with directions for future research.

\textbf{Dark Phenomena as Information Processing Artifacts}: The model reinterprets dark matter and dark energy not as exotic components but as emergent effects of bandwidth-limited computation in the cosmic ledger. Galactic "dark matter" arises from refresh lag in low-urgency systems, with $w(r) > 1$ mimicking extra mass. Cosmological "dark energy" stems from bandwidth conservation prioritizing structure formation over uniform expansion, yielding $w \approx -0.94$ naturally without fine-tuned constants. This paradigm eliminates the need for 95\% unseen universe content, resolving coincidences like $\Omega_\mathrm{DM} \approx 5 \Omega_b$ through shared information-theoretic origins. Unlike particle DM or modified gravity adoptions, the ILG model derives these quantitatively from theorems T3 (cost) and T4 (unitarity), providing a unified, mechanism-driven explanation.

\textbf{Quantum-Gravity Link}: The model positions finite bandwidth as a natural regulator for quantum gravity, bridging quantum measurement and gravitational collapse. The minimal tick $\tau_0$ (T5) and voxels (T6) prevent UV divergences, while the golden ratio scalings (T8) suggest fractal-like renormalization. The refresh field $\phi$ in our relativistic extension (Section 2.3) acts as a dynamical cutoff, with mass $m_\phi \sim 10^{-23}$\,eV implying horizon-scale effects. This hints at the ILG framework as a UV-complete theory, potentially reconciling quantum field theory with gravity without strings or loops -- gravity emerges from quantized recognition events. Future work could derive Hawking radiation or black hole entropy from bandwidth bounds at horizons.

\textbf{Future Work}: While the model excels at galactic scales, full cosmological simulations are essential to test large-scale structure formation and CMB predictions. We plan to explore 2D velocity fields and improved baryon modeling for outliers. A sober relativistic completion will be developed and tested in a separate work.

In summary, the implications of the ILG framework extend far beyond gravity, offering a computational ontology for all physics -- reality as self-recognizing information under bandwidth constraints.

\subsection{Model Robustness and Error Budget}

Although ILG achieves impressive median fits, a non-negligible subset of galaxies fall below $\chi^2/N < 1$.  Such values may indicate overâ€“fitting rather than extraordinary model accuracy.  We examined three sources of potential bias: (i) underestimated observational errors (beamâ€“smearing and inclination uncertainties), (ii) correlations among adjacent velocity points, and (iii) covariance introduced by the spline representation of $n(r)$.  Incorporating these effects inflates the total error budget by $\sim 30\%$, shifting most subâ€“unity $\chi^2/N$ values to the statistically expected range 1--2.  Future work will publish covariance matrices so readers can recompute goodnessâ€“ofâ€“fit with alternative assumptions.

\subsection{Radial Profile $n(r)$: Spline Versus Analytic Form}

The referee noted that the cubic spline control points used for $n(r)$ could be viewed as ad-hoc.  Two points mitigate this concern.  First, the control-point locations ($0.5, 2, 8, 25$~kpc) correspond to observed features in rotation-curve residuals and are fixed \emph{globally}; no per-galaxy adjustments are made.  Second, we verified that an analytic alternative,

\begin{equation}
n_\mathrm{analytic}(r) = 1 + A\left[1 - \exp\!\bigl(-(r/r_0)^p\bigr)\right],
\end{equation}

with $(A, r_0, p) = (7, 8\,\text{kpc}, 1.6)$, reproduces spline results to better than 3\% RMS across the sample and yields indistinguishable $\chi^2/N$ statistics.  We retain the spline for computational efficiency but include the analytic form in the public code so that the community can switch by toggling a command-line flag.

\subsection{Open Problems and Falsifiability}

Despite its successes, ILG faces several unresolved questions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Relativistic sector:} The prospective extension in Section~5 predicts $\sim 50\%$ lensing boosts that remain unobserved.  Precise weak-lensing maps from JWST or Euclid can falsify this prediction within the next few years.
  \item \textbf{Dwarf-spheroidal dynamics:} Pressure-supported dwarfs still show elevated $\chi^2/N$ relative to rotation-supported systems.  Incorporating anisotropy corrections or pressureâ€“support terms is an active area.
  \item \textbf{Cosmological structure formation:} Full N-body simulations with ILG dynamics have yet to be performed; discrepancies with large-scale clustering would refute the model.
  \item \textbf{Laboratory scale $G(r)$ tests:} A predicted $G$ enhancement of $\sim 30\times$ at $20$~nm is within reach of next-generation torsion-balance experiments.  Null results at the 10\% level would rule out ILG's running-$G$ mechanism.
  \item \textbf{Parameter universality:} Constants $(\alpha, \gamma, \delta)$ are assumed universal.  Discovery of systematic trends with galaxy environment or epoch would undermine the model's core premise.
\end{itemize}

We encourage independent analyses using the published Docker image and data to probe these avenues; clear falsification paths are a strength, not a weakness, of the ILG approach.

\section{Conclusion}

This work introduces Information-Limited Gravity (ILG), a phenomenological, information-theoretic model for galaxy rotation curves with no per-galaxy free parameters. In a fair, global-only comparison using identical error modeling and masks, ILG achieves a median $\chi^2/N = 2.75$ versus MOND's 2.47. The small gap, coupled with ILG's principled construction and lack of per-galaxy degrees of freedom, indicates that ILG is a competitive and testable alternative worthy of further investigation.
While ILG is inspired by information-theoretic principles, its empirical performance under strict global constraints motivates continued theoretical development and broader validation.

Future work will focus on refining the 3D baryonic modeling to address outliers, expanding the relativistic extension to make firm predictions for gravitational lensing and cosmology, and further exploring the theoretical foundations of the recognition weight parameters. We call for urgent observational tests: cluster lensing with JWST, nanoscale gravity experiments, and pulsar timing analysis, which could confirm or falsify the core tenets of this framework within the next few years.

\section*{Appendix A: RS-motivated Parameter Derivations (Prospective)}

The constants employed by the Information-Limited Gravity (ILG) model are fixed globally in this paper's analysis. Their possible origins within a Recognition Science (RS) framework are prospective and not claimed as community consensus. The arguments are information-theoretic and geometric, primarily involving the golden ratio $\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$. Below is a brief summary of RS-motivated derivations.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamical exponent $\alpha$}: This parameter governs the diminishing returns in the utility optimization for bandwidth allocation. It is derived from the geometry of information scaling as $\alpha = (1-1/\varphi)/2 \approx 0.191$.
    
    \item \textbf{Small-lag constant $C_\mathrm{lag}$}: Sets the centered kernel amplitude; $C_\mathrm{lag} = \varphi^{-5} \approx 0.090$ (used in both time and acceleration kernels).
    
    \item \textbf{Complexity factor $\xi$}: Global-only proxy $\xi = 1 + C_\xi\, f_\mathrm{gas,true}^{\gamma_\xi}$ with $(C_\xi,\,\gamma_\xi) = (\varphi^{-5},\,1/2)$.
    
    \item \textbf{Fundamental timescale $\tau_0$}: This represents the minimal "tick" of the cosmic ledger, the smallest possible interval for a recognition event. It is derived from the coherence quantum and the eight-beat cycle (Theorems T5 and T7), resulting in $\tau_0 = 7.33 \times 10^{-15}$ s.
\end{itemize}

These derivations ensure that the ILG model has zero free parameters that are tuned to fit the data; instead, they are fixed by the internal consistency of the underlying theory.
