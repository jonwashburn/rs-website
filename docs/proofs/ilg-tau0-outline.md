# ILG Kernel and τ0 Derivations

Objectives:
- Derive w(k,a)=1+φ^(−3/2)[a/(k τ0)]^α with α=½(1−1/φ) from axioms (no fits).
- Derive τ0=2π/(8 ln φ) from universal scheduler and 8-beat timing closure.

Sketch:
- ILG: Start from continuity of cost flow and discrete tick scheduling; show scale-separation exponent α via φ-similarity across ticks; derive prefactor from voxel geometry and dual-balance weighting.
- τ0: Show that minimizing scheduler entropy over 8-beat cycle with φ-clock yields phase closure at 2π, forcing τ0 as stated.

Deliverables: short derivations and a validation plot against cosmological growth predictions (P(k), lensing).
