    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Evolution is the process through which organisms change over generations, driven by mechanisms such as natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. It is a fundamental concept in biology that explains the diversity of life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>In biological terms, evolution refers to the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. It is the process by which species adapt to their environments, leading to the development of new species from common ancestors.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Foundation</summary>
        <p>The mathematical representation of evolutionary change can be expressed through models such as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which describes the genetic variation in a population under ideal conditions.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Evolution is like a long, ongoing experiment where nature tests different traits in organisms. Those that are better suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce, passing their advantageous traits to the next generation. Over time, this leads to changes in the species, sometimes resulting in entirely new species.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding evolution is crucial for various fields, including medicine, ecology, and conservation. It helps us comprehend how species adapt to changing environments, the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Evolution operates through several mechanisms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Natural Selection:</strong> The process where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutation:</strong> Random changes in DNA that can lead to new traits.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic Drift:</strong> Random changes in allele frequencies in a population, which can lead to significant changes over time, especially in small populations.</li>
        <li><strong>Gene Flow:</strong> The transfer of genetic material between populations, which can introduce new genetic variation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <p>Key properties of evolution include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> The process by which a species becomes better suited to its environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Speciation:</strong> The formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution.</li>
        <li><strong>Common Descent:</strong> The principle that all living organisms share a common ancestor.</li>
        <li><strong>Gradualism:</strong> The idea that evolution occurs slowly and steadily over long periods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Foundation</summary>
        <p>Evolutionary processes can be modeled mathematically using equations that describe population genetics, such as the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which provides a baseline for understanding genetic variation in a population under equilibrium conditions.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>Evolution is closely related to various fields of study, including genetics, paleontology, and ecology. It provides a unifying framework for understanding the biological sciences and is fundamental to the study of life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Falsifiable predictions related to evolution include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Species that share a more recent common ancestor will have more similar genetic material.</li>
        <li>Populations subjected to different environmental pressures will evolve distinct traits over time.</li>
        <li>Fossil records will show a gradual change in species over time, supporting the theory of gradualism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>Some common misconceptions about evolution include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evolution is a linear process leading to a "perfect" organism.</li>
        <li>Individuals evolve during their lifetimes.</li>
        <li>Natural selection is the only mechanism of evolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is natural selection?</h3>
    <p>Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution where individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.</p>

    <h3>Can evolution be observed in real-time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, evolution can be observed in real-time, particularly in organisms with short generation times, such as bacteria and insects.</p>

    <h3>Is evolution just a theory?</h3>
    <p>In scientific terms, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world. Evolution is supported by a vast body of evidence from multiple scientific disciplines.</p>
