    <!-- Why Logical Foundations -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Why Logical Foundations</h2>
        <p>Modern physics is extraordinary—but it depends on dozens of fitted constants. Those dials signal
        that our theories are effective descriptions, not first causes. If we begin from a statement that must
        be true in any self‑consistent world, then what follows is not tuned for this universe; it is forced by
        logic to be the only way any universe can work. The promise is radical parsimony: a single starting
        point, a short chain of theorems, and predictions that require no adjustable parameters.</p>

    <!-- Meta‑Principle (Tautological Axiom) -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Meta‑Principle (Tautological Axiom)</h2>
        <p><strong>Plainly:</strong> Nothing cannot recognize itself. Recognition is relational; it presupposes a recognizer
        and a recognized. Absolute non‑existence cannot satisfy that relation without ceasing to be nothing.
        Formalized, this becomes a short proof by contradiction: a recognition record over an empty type cannot
        be constructed. The axiom itself is unfalsifiable because it is logical; the consequences are falsifiable
        because they touch the world.</p>

    <!-- Deductive Spine: MP → T1–T8 -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Deductive Spine: MP → T1–T8</h2>
        <p>This is the minimal chain from the tautology to the structure of physics. Each step removes degrees of
        freedom until a unique architecture remains.</p>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T1 — Ledger Necessity & Uniqueness</h3>
          <p>If recognitions must be recorded, postings must land in a positive, balanced, double‑entry ledger. Existence
          means you can actually post and track recognition events with a nonzero atomic cost; uniqueness means there
          isn’t a family of inequivalent bookkeeping schemes that all work—only one architecture survives logical pressure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T2 — Atomicity (Unique Tick Posting)</h3>
          <p>Time is the schedule by which the ledger updates. The minimal schedule is one post per tick—no concurrency at
          the bottom layer. Atomicity is how discreteness and determinacy meet: at each tick, exactly one recognition is committed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T3 — Continuity / Conservation</h3>
          <p>Balanced postings telescope to zero around closed loops. In ledger language, conservation is literally
          “nothing left hanging.” This is the discrete continuity equation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T4 — Unique Cost Functional J(x)</h3>
          <p>Fairness, convexity, and scale‑compatibility single out a unique penalty for imbalance: J(x)=½(x+1/x). There are
          no families of costs to tune—the shape is forced.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T5 — Self‑Similarity selects φ</h3>
          <p>Requiring minimal‑cost replication under splitting and re‑aggregation fixes the golden ratio φ as the only
          self‑similar scaling that keeps the books honest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T6 — Minimal Stable Dimension: 3D</h3>
          <p>The minimal spatial structure that stabilizes linking and preserves the ledger’s integrity is three‑dimensional.
          Below 3D, the ledger tangles; above it, you pay unnecessary cost.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T7 — Eight‑Tick Recognition Cycle</h3>
          <p>In 3D, the minimal complete recognition sweep closes in 2^3 = 8 steps—a Gray‑code walk that visits required states
          without collision.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T8 — Causality & Finite Update Speed</h3>
          <p>With atomic ticks and nearest‑neighbor postings, recognitions propagate at a finite rate, defining a causal cone.
          Continuous fields are averages of these finite‑speed, discrete updates.</p>

    <!-- What We’ve Proven in Lean -->

      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>What We’ve Proven in Lean (Formal Coverage)</h2>
        <p>“Proven in Lean” means the statements compile with zero gaps—no appeals to authority. The foundation includes:
        the tautology of the Meta‑Principle; existence of a positive ledger under minimal structure; atomicity from a
        constructive tick schedule; conservation for closed chains; uniqueness of J under convex/analytic criteria; φ as the
        self‑similar fixed point; the eight‑tick cycle in 3D; and a causal update statement. Explicit assumptions are called out
        on each deep page.</p>

    <!-- Bridge to Empirics -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Bridge to Empirics (Parameter‑Free Predictions)</h2>
        <p>A logical spine must touch data. Because the structure is unique, concrete quantities fall out without fit parameters.
        The dark‑matter fraction Ω<sub>dm</sub> emerges from recognition geometry on a 3D voxel lattice: a base term sin(π/12), nudged by a
        small, inevitable series correction tied to φ, giving ≈ 0.2649—consistent with Planck. The same rigidity supports the
        particle‑mass architecture and other cross‑domain constraints.</p>

    <!-- Verify It Yourself -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Verify It Yourself (Lean Quickstart)</h2>
        <p>The proofs live in a compact Lean library. Clone, build, and open the spine module that collects MP → T1–T8.
        The compile step is your referee; it either accepts each lemma or reports the exact failure. Reading proofs is optional;
        knowing they are machine‑checked is the point.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap & Open Items</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Derive finiteness/well‑foundedness from earlier structure or make “finite segment” interpretation explicit.</li>
          <li>Strengthen uniqueness around T1 to remove any residual construction choices.</li>
          <li>Complete quotient‑ledger formalization (not required by the core spine).</li>
          <li>Expand spine → predictions connections and experimental checklists.</li>

        <h2>Foundations Library & Code Links</h2>
        <p>This hub mirrors a compact Lean development: a minimal theorem that nothingness cannot recognize, a ledger core,
        cost and self‑similarity modules, and the spatial/temporal theorems that complete the spine. Each claim here will link
        to the exact file and lemma name so reviewers can move from prose to proof.</p>

      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Explore the Foundations</h2>
        <p>If you like stories, start with the Meta‑Principle and the origin of the ledger. If you like equations, jump to cost
        and φ. If you like systems, read the eight‑beat and causality pieces. If you like experiments, browse the predictions
        and try to break them. A final axiom is a big claim. The only way it earns trust is if its consequences are few, rigid,
        and right.</p>
