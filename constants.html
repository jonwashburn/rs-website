        <p class="hero-lead">
          Imagine trying to build a universe. You'd need to set dozens of dials—the speed of light, 
          the strength of gravity, the mass of an electron. Set any dial wrong by even 1%, and your 
          universe collapses. Stars don't form. Atoms don't hold. Chemistry never begins.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Our universe got every dial exactly right. Not approximately right—exactly right, 
          to twelve decimal places and beyond. Physics has spent centuries measuring these numbers. 
          <strong>Recognition Science finally explains why they couldn't be anything else.</strong>

        <h2 class="section-title">The Universe's Source Code</h2>
        <div class="reading">
          <p>Think of constants as the universe's source code—the fundamental settings that determine how everything works. Every equation in physics contains these unchanging numbers. The speed of light tells spacetime how fast to propagate information. Planck's constant tells energy how small it can be divided. The gravitational constant tells mass how strongly to bend space.</p>
          
          <p>But here's what most people miss: these aren't arbitrary settings. They're the universe's commitments—promises it made at the beginning and can never break. The speed of light isn't just fast; it's exactly <span class="highlight-number">299,792,458</span> meters per second. The fine-structure constant isn't roughly 1/137; it's precisely <span class="highlight-number">1/137.035999084...</span></p>
          
          <p>Why these exact values? Why not slightly different ones? Traditional physics shrugs—we measure what we measure. Recognition Science has a stunning answer: <strong>these are the only values that allow recognition to occur without contradiction.</strong></p>

    <!-- The Mystery -->

        <h2 class="section-title">The Cosmic Fine-Tuning Mystery</h2>
        <div class="reading">
          <div class="mystery-box">
            <p class="mystery-text">
              Here's the embarrassment of modern physics: we can measure the fine-structure constant to 
              twelve decimal places (<span class="highlight-number">1/137.035999084...</span>), but we have no idea why it has that value. 
              We know the electron's mass to exquisite precision (<span class="highlight-number">0.51099895000 MeV</span>), 
              but it enters our equations as an arbitrary input. The Standard Model—our best theory—contains 
              <span class="highlight-number">26 such free parameters</span> that we simply measure and plug in.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>It gets worse. These constants appear impossibly fine-tuned for life. If the strong force were 2% weaker, protons couldn't bind—no atoms beyond hydrogen. If gravity were slightly stronger, stars would burn too fast for planets to develop life. If the electron were heavier than the neutron-proton mass difference, atoms would collapse. We exist in an absurdly narrow window of possibility.</p>
          
          <p>Physicists call this the "fine-tuning problem." Some invoke multiverses—infinite failed universes where we couldn't exist to observe them. Others claim it's just luck. Recognition Science offers a third option: <strong>these values are forced by logical necessity</strong>. The universe has these constants because no other values would allow consistent recognition to occur.</p>
