# Mass Spectrum: Plan and Requirements

Formula: m_i = B_i · E_coh · φ^(r_i + f_i)

Needed to close:
- Publish minimal LNAL constructions per SM particle → fixes (B_i, r_i).
- Define μ* (universal matching scale) from clock/ladder.
- Compute f_i via: f_i = (1/ln φ) ∫_{ln m_i}^{ln μ*} γ_i(μ) d ln μ + Σ_m g_m I_m(i), with g_m from F(z).

Deliverables:
- Table of (B_i, r_i) with opcode sequences.
- Notebook running 2-loop SM RGEs to compute f_i and masses; error budget from coupling uncertainties and series truncation.
