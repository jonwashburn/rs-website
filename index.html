                <h1>A Measurement of Reality</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">Recognition Science is not a model to be fitted to data. It is a rigid, deductive structure whose complete output is a single, empirical measurement of the universe's unique, logically necessary architecture.</p>

                <h2>The Crisis of Tunable Dials</h2>
                <p>Modern physics is a triumph of description, yet it rests on a foundation of profound mystery. The Standard Model and Cosmology are defined by over two dozen "free parameters"—constants like the mass of an electron or the strength of gravity, whose values are not explained by theory but must be measured and plugged in by hand. Our most fundamental theories are like complex machines with exquisitely tuned dials, but we have no idea why the dials are set to those specific, life-permitting values.</p>
                <p>This signifies a deep incompleteness in our understanding. A truly fundamental theory should not be tuned to reality; it should derive reality from its core principles. Recognition Science resolves this crisis by inverting the scientific method. It collapses the distinction between a theory and an empirical measurement.</p>
                <p><strong>Here, logic is the instrument and deduction is the procedure. The framework itself is the measurement—a complete blueprint of the only possible reality, derived before any observation.</strong></p>
                <p>It begins with a single, proven statement of logical consistency and derives a complete set of laws and constants. This framework is the singular result of the measurement. The verification is the astonishing, high-precision match between this logical output and the universe observed through traditional experiments.</p>
