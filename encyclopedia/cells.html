    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Cells are fundamental units of life, serving as the basic building blocks of all living organisms. They exhibit defined boundaries and internal organization, allowing them to perform the essential functions necessary for life.</p>
</section>

<section class="definition">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A cell is a membrane-bound structure that contains the biological machinery necessary for life. It can exist as a single unit (unicellular) or as part of a multicellular organism.</p>
</section>

<section class="in-plain-english">
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Cells are like tiny factories that make up all living things. Each cell is surrounded by a protective outer layer called the membrane, which keeps everything inside. Inside the cell, there are various parts that work together to keep the cell alive and functioning. These parts help the cell take in nutrients, produce energy, and get rid of waste. Some organisms are made up of just one cell, while others, like humans, are made up of trillions of cells working together.</p>
</section>

<section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding cells is crucial because they are the basic units of life. All biological processes, from growth and reproduction to response to the environment, occur at the cellular level. By studying cells, scientists can learn about health, disease, and the fundamental principles of biology.</p>
</section>

<section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Cells function through a complex interplay of various organelles and structures. The cell membrane regulates what enters and exits the cell, while the nucleus contains genetic material that directs cellular activities. Organelles like mitochondria produce energy, ribosomes synthesize proteins, and lysosomes break down waste. This organization allows cells to maintain homeostasis and respond to changes in their environment.</p>

<section class="key-properties">
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Membrane-bound:</strong> Cells are enclosed by a lipid bilayer that controls the movement of substances.</li>
        <li><strong>Self-replicating:</strong> Cells can reproduce through processes like mitosis and meiosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic activity:</strong> Cells carry out biochemical reactions that sustain life.</li>
        <li><strong>Response to stimuli:</strong> Cells can react to environmental changes, allowing them to adapt and survive.</li>
    </ul>

<section class="mathematical-foundation">
    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Concepts</summary>
        <p>The study of cells often involves mathematical modeling to understand processes such as population dynamics, cellular growth rates, and diffusion of substances across membranes. These models can be expressed using differential equations and statistical methods.</p>
    </details>
</section>

<section class="connections">
    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>Cells are connected to various fields of study, including genetics, biochemistry, and ecology. They are also fundamental to understanding diseases, as many conditions arise from cellular dysfunction. Research in cell biology informs advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and environmental science.</p>
</section>

<section class="testable-predictions">
    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Research on cells can lead to predictions about cellular behavior under various conditions. For example, scientists can predict how cells will respond to different drugs or environmental changes. These predictions can be tested through experiments, leading to a better understanding of cellular mechanisms.</p>
</section>

<section class="common-misconceptions">
    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>One common misconception is that all cells are the same. In reality, cells can vary greatly in structure and function, depending on their type and the organism they belong to. Another misconception is that cells can survive indefinitely; in fact, cells have a lifespan and will eventually die or become senescent.</p>
</section>

<section class="faqs">
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What are the main types of cells?</h3>
    <p>There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic (e.g., bacteria) and eukaryotic (e.g., plant and animal cells). Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a defined nucleus and various organelles.</p>
    
    <h3>How do cells communicate with each other?</h3>
    <p>Cells communicate through chemical signals, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. They can also use direct contact through gap junctions or plasmodesmata in plants.</p>
