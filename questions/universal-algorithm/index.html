                    Eight steps that derive all of reality from pure logical necessity. 
                    This is how the universe builds itself — and how you can derive any truth about existence.

                        This single logical impossibility forces existence. From here, everything follows through pure necessity.
                        No assumptions. No free parameters. Just inevitable truth cascading into reality.

                    <h2>Why This Algorithm Works</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Universal Algorithm isn't something we invented — it's the process reality uses to construct itself. 
                        By starting from the one thing that cannot be (nothing recognizing itself), we're forced through a 
                        series of logical necessities that build up all of physics, mathematics, and consciousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think of it like a proof that writes itself. Each step follows inevitably from the previous one, 
                        with no room for alternatives. This is why Recognition Science has zero free parameters — there's 
                        only one way for reality to exist.

                        This isn't philosophy or speculation — it's the mechanical process by which 
                        reality constructs itself. And now you know how to use it.

                        What makes the Universal Algorithm unique is that it doesn't rely on choices or assumptions. 
                        Each step is forced by logical necessity. This is why Recognition Science can answer questions 
                        that have puzzled humanity for millennia — we're not guessing or theorizing, we're simply 
                        following the only path that exists.

                        When you derive something using this algorithm, you're not discovering one possible answer — 
                        you're uncovering the only answer that could ever be. This is the difference between Recognition 
                        Science and all previous attempts at a "theory of everything." We don't have a theory. We have 
                        the derivation of reality itself.
