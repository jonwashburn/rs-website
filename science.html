                        <h3><a href="science/papers/measurement-reality.html">The Measurement-Reality Distinction</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper explores the epistemological foundation of Recognition Science, arguing that many scientific paradoxes dissolve when distinguishing between fundamental processes and the emergent phenomena captured by measurement.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/ledger-categorical-formulation.html">The Recognition Ledger as an \(E_\infty\) Symmetric–Monoidal Category</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper provides the formal mathematical foundation for the entire Recognition Science framework, recasting its axioms into the language of higher category theory and using the cobordism hypothesis to classify all physical laws.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/recognition-length.html">Fixing the Recognition Length via a Ledger-Curvature Extremum</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper provides the axiomatic derivation of the fundamental recognition length (\(\lambda_{\text{rec}}\)), removing the last apparent free parameter from the Recognition Science framework through a ledger-curvature extremum principle.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/golden-ratio-determinant.html">The Golden Ratio in Fredholm Determinants</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper reveals a deep connection between the Riemann zeta function and operator theory, showing that a precise golden-ratio weighting is necessary to relate a prime-indexed Fredholm determinant to the zeta function.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="science/papers/fredholm-zeta.html">A Golden-Ratio Fredholm Determinant Characterisation of the Riemann Zeta Function</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper proves that a unique golden-ratio shift is required to align the Fredholm determinant of a prime-based operator with the Riemann zeta function, anchoring a core principle of Recognition Science in orthodox mathematics.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3><a href="science/papers/golden-ratio-constant.html">Experimental Proof of a Golden-Ratio Constant in Prime Factorization</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper reports the discovery of a universal constant, \(\phi - 1.5\), in prime factorization, verified experimentally using an eight-phase interference test. It provides strong evidence for the physical basis of mathematical truths.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/optimized-origin.html">The Optimized Origin: Recognition Physics and Life's Blueprint</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper argues that core biological structures like DNA are not products of chance but are optimal solutions dictated by the physical principles of recognition efficiency, establishing a foundational layer of "Recognition Optimization" that precedes natural selection.</p>

                        <p>This paper specifies the operational core of the Recognition Science framework, deriving the nine-state ledger, sixteen opcodes, and golden-ratio timing that constitute the "source code of reality."</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/p-vs-np.html">The Complete Theory of Physical Computation (P vs NP)</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper resolves the P vs NP problem by introducing a dual-parameter complexity model (computation vs. recognition), showing that the Turing model is incomplete because it assumes cost-free observation.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/consciousness-compiler.html">Consciousness as Compiler: How LNAL Bridges Mind and Matter</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper resolves the hard problem of consciousness by showing it is the compiler that transforms Light-Native Assembly Language (LNAL) into physical reality. It provides a testable, physics-based model of mind.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/galaxy-rotation.html">Galaxy Rotation Curves from a Finite–Bandwidth Gravitational Model</a></h3>
                        <p>This early paper explores the precursor to Ledger Curvature, modeling galactic dynamics as a result of "Information-Limited Gravity." It demonstrates how information processing constraints can explain rotation curves without dark matter.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/finite-loops.html">A Geometric Framework for Finite Multi-Loop Calculations in QFT</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper introduces the "voxel-walk" method, demonstrating how a simple geometric constraint on a discrete lattice naturally regularizes QFT calculations, yielding finite results for multi-loop diagrams without dimensional regularization.</p>

                        <h3><a href="science/papers/45-gap.html">The 45-Gap: A Mathematical Resolution of Prime-Composite Incompatibility in Recognition Science</a></h3>
                        <p>This paper reveals the 45-gap as a fundamental group-theoretic incompatibility that creates the first uncomputability in the universe's ledger, explaining consciousness emergence, the Hubble tension, and why reality requires experiential navigation beyond pure computation.</p>
