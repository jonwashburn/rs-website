    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Hawking radiation is a theoretical prediction that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near their event horizons. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity, suggesting that black holes are not entirely black but can lose mass and energy over time.</p>
</section>

<section class="definition">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Hawking radiation refers to the thermal radiation predicted to be emitted by black holes, resulting from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon. It is described mathematically by the relationship:</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
        <p>Hawking radiation can be characterized by a temperature given by:</p>
        <p>T = (ħc^3)/(8πGMk_B)</p>
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ħ is the reduced Planck's constant</li>
            <li>c is the speed of light</li>
            <li>G is the gravitational constant</li>
            <li>M is the mass of the black hole</li>
            <li>k_B is the Boltzmann constant</li>
        </ul>
    </details>
</section>

<section class="in-plain-english">
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Hawking radiation occurs when pairs of virtual particles pop into existence near a black hole's event horizon. If one particle falls into the black hole while the other escapes, the escaping particle becomes real and can be detected as radiation. This process implies that black holes can gradually lose mass and may eventually evaporate completely.</p>
</section>

<section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Hawking radiation is significant because it bridges the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. It challenges the classical notion that black holes are completely black and introduces the concept of black hole thermodynamics. This has profound implications for our understanding of information loss in black holes and the ultimate fate of the universe.</p>
</section>

<section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The mechanism of Hawking radiation relies on quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Near the event horizon, quantum fluctuations can create particle-antiparticle pairs. If one of these particles falls into the black hole while the other escapes, the escaping particle is detected as radiation. This process results in a net loss of mass for the black hole, leading to its eventual evaporation.</p>
</section>

<section class="key-properties">
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> The temperature of Hawking radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole; smaller black holes emit radiation at higher temperatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Black Hole Evaporation:</strong> Over time, a black hole can lose mass due to Hawking radiation, potentially leading to its complete evaporation.</li>
        <li><strong>Thermal Nature:</strong> The radiation is thermal and can be described by a black body spectrum, implying that black holes have entropy and temperature.</li>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>Can Hawking radiation be observed directly?</h3>
    <p>As of now, Hawking radiation has not been directly observed. However, theoretical predictions suggest that it may be detectable from small black holes or through indirect measurements.</p>
    
    <h3>What happens to the information that falls into a black hole?</h3>
    <p>The fate of information is a significant topic of debate in theoretical physics, often referred to as the "black hole information paradox." Hawking radiation suggests that information may be preserved, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.</p>
