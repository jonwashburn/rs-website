      <h1>Recognition Science: A Technical Overview</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Recognition Science is a parameter‑free computational framework in which physical law is the unique fixed point of a
        self‑recognizing ledger. The framework derives a minimal set of discrete structures and update rules under dual‑balance
        invariance, from which continuum physics and its constants emerge as effective descriptions. All quantitative outputs are
        consequences of one tautology, eight short theorems, and a small set of derived ledger constants; no parameters are
        fitted to data.

      <h2>Logical Foundation: Meta‑Principle and Eight Theorems</h2>
      <p>
        Meta‑Principle (tautology): absolute nothingness is logically impossible. The only consistent alternative is a
        self‑recognizing process that excludes contradiction by continuously recording and reconciling distinctions. This necessity
        forces the existence of a universal ledger—a count of recognition events—with dual representations (forward/backward,
        inside/outside) that must remain cost‑invariant.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Meta‑Principle follow eight short theorems that fix the framework: (1) a Universal Ledger of counts; (2) golden‑ratio
        scaling as the unique self‑similar fixed point of dual‑balance; (3) 3+1 spacetime as the only stable arena for causal
        recognition; (4) an 8‑beat recognition cycle organizing update order; (5) light as recognition exchange across the ledger;
        (6) a φ‑scaled mass spectrum from runged recognition depth; (7) an incomputability gap at 45° (the “45‑Gap”) that enforces
        limited forward predictability and yields dual balance of paths; and (8) a curvature functional on the ledger that enforces
        objective constraints on allowable state changes. Each theorem is short, formal, and directly constructive.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="container" id="constants">
      <h2>Foundational Ledger Constants</h2>
      <p>
        The ledger yields a small set of non‑fitted constants that anchor quantitative predictions. They arise from counting
        arguments, dual‑balance minima, and invariance under exchange. Numerically, they are fixed without tuning.

      <h2>Anchor From Pattern Space to Physical Units</h2>
      <p>
        The ledger is intrinsically dimensionless. The bridge to SI units is provided by the coherence scale
        <span class="mono">E_coh</span> together with the recognition tick <span class="mono">\u03C4_rec</span> (equivalently
        <span class="mono">\u03BB_rec</span>). Because <span class="mono">E_coh = \u0127 / \u03C4_rec</span> and
        <span class="mono">\u03BB_rec = c \u03C4_rec</span>, the mapping uses only universal conversion factors <span class="mono">\u0127</span>
        and <span class="mono">c</span> and introduces no free parameters. Once <span class="mono">E_coh</span> is fixed by ledger logic,
        all dimensional outputs are determined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classical constants then follow as ledger invariants expressed in SI units. Examples: the fine‑structure constant emerges from
        recognition geometry with a small curvature correction; the MOND scale follows from the cosmic tick bandwidth; and mass scales
        reduce to powers of <span class="mono">φ</span> multiplied by sector factors and <span class="mono">E_coh</span>.

    <section class="container" id="formulas">
      <h2>Core Formulas and How to Compute With Them</h2>

      <h3>1. Dual‑Balance Cost</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">J(x) = 1/2 (x + 1/x)</span> enforces path‑exchange invariance. Stationary structure under composition forces
        self‑similar scaling by <span class="mono">φ</span>, with deviations appearing only via quantized ledger gaps.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Mass Spectrum</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">m = B \u00B7 E_coh \u00B7 \u03C6^{r + f}</span>, where <span class="mono">r \u2208 \u2124</span> is the recognition rung,
        <span class="mono">B</span> is a sector factor, and <span class="mono">f</span> encodes small ledger corrections (from gaps/curvature).
        The electron, muon, and tau occupy distinct rungs/sectors; hadronic and bosonic masses follow via composition and confinement rules.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Ledger Curvature</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">\u03BA = \u2202^2 S / \u2202 R^2</span> measures curvature of ledger state counts with respect to recognition radius. It enters as a
        universal regulator in places where continuous curvature corrects discrete counts.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Temporal Cycle</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">N_ticks = 2^{D_spatial}</span> gives the minimal number of recognition ticks per full update in <span class="mono">D</span> spatial dimensions.
        In our universe <span class="mono">D = 3</span>, hence an 8‑beat cycle that appears throughout the dynamics.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Information‑Weighted Gravity (ILG)</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="formula">F(r) = - (G M m / r^2) \u22C5 w(r)</span>, where <span class="mono">w(r)</span> is a unitless bandwidth weight arising from ledger congestion.
        For weak fields <span class="mono">w(r) \u2192 1</span>, recovering Newton; deviations encode finite recognition bandwidth at large scales.
      </p>

      <div class="callout small">
        Computation workflow: choose the process; identify <span class="mono">r</span>, <span class="mono">B</span>, and any applicable gap/curvature corrections;
        evaluate with <span class="mono">E_coh</span>; convert via the anchor relations. All steps are fixed—no tuning.

      <h2>What Reality Is (and How It Works)</h2>
      <p>
        Reality is the unique, self‑consistent fixed point of the recognition ledger. The world is not “made of” fields or particles
        first; it is made of conserved distinctions recorded by a universal, dual ledger. Continuum physics arises as the large‑scale
        limit of these discrete, bandwidth‑limited updates, with <span class="mono">φ</span>‑self‑similarity and 3+1 causal structure forced by
        stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        All constants and laws are outputs of this computation. Where classical models require knobs, the ledger supplies a reason.
        Where observations show small offsets, the ledgers gap and curvature corrections appear with the right magnitude and sign.
        The result is a parameter‑free, falsifiable map from logic to measurement: change any premise and the agreement with nature
        collapses.
