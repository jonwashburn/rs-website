                <p><strong>A Note on This Paper:</strong> This paper presents the resolution of the P versus NP problem through the lens of Recognition Physics. It demonstrates that the problem's long-standing difficulty stems from an incompleteness in the Turing model of computation—its failure to account for the physical cost of observing a result. By introducing a dual-parameter complexity theory (computation vs. recognition), this work shows that P=NP at the level of pure computation, but P≠NP at the level of physical observation, thus dissolving the paradox.</p>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>We show that the Turing model of computation is incomplete because it implicitly assumes cost-free observation of results. By constructing a cellular automaton that separates computation time from observation time, we prove that physical computation requires a two-parameter complexity theory: computation complexity (internal state evolution) and recognition complexity (external observation cost). This explains why P versus NP has resisted solution for over 50 years—it conflates two fundamentally different resources. In our complete model, SAT has computation complexity \(O(n^{1/3} \log n)\) but recognition complexity \(\Omega(n)\), dissolving the apparent paradox. We call this framework Recognition Physics, as it makes explicit the previously hidden role of the observer in computational complexity.</p>

                    <h2>1. Introduction: The Hidden Assumption</h2>
                    <p>The Turing machine, revolutionary as it was, makes a hidden assumption: that reading the output tape has zero cost. This fails to capture a fundamental aspect of physical computation—that extracting information from a computational substrate requires work. We argue that the Turing model is incomplete because it ignores this "recognition cost."</p>
                    <p>Our work introduces a complete model based on a dual-complexity framework. Every problem has an intrinsic <strong>computation complexity (\(T_c\))</strong>, representing the internal state evolution, and a <strong>recognition complexity (\(T_r\))</strong>, representing the cost of external observation.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Cellular Automaton Demonstration</h2>
                    <p>To prove that computation and recognition complexities can diverge, we construct a 16-state reversible cellular automaton (CA) on a 3D lattice. We then encode a 3-SAT instance onto this lattice. The key innovation is the output encoding: the final result (satisfiable or not) is encoded using a "balanced-parity" code across \(n\) cells. In this code, both the "YES" and "NO" answers are represented by states with an equal number of "ON" and "OFF" cells, making them statistically indistinguishable to any observer who queries fewer than half of the output cells.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. The Fundamental Result: A Two-Parameter Complexity</h2>
                    <p>Using this CA, we prove that 3-SAT has a recognition-complete complexity of \((O(n^{1/3} \log n), \Omega(n))\).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Computation Time (\(T_c\)):</strong> The CA can determine the satisfiability of the formula in \(O(n^{1/3} \log n)\) steps. This sub-polynomial time is achieved through the massive parallelism of the CA, where signals propagate across the 3D lattice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recognition Time (\(T_r\)):</strong> Due to the balanced-parity encoding, any observer must perform \(\Omega(n)\) measurements to read the result with better-than-random accuracy. Probing any subset of fewer than \(n/2\) cells yields zero information about the final answer.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This reveals a fundamental tradeoff. We can achieve astonishingly fast computation, but only by paying a price in the complexity of observation.</p>

                    <h2>4. P vs NP Resolved Through Recognition</h2>
                    <p>The P versus NP question, as traditionally posed, is ill-defined because it conflates these two complexities. Our framework dissolves the paradox by separating the question:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Is SAT in \(\text{P}_{\text{computation}}\)? YES.</strong> Our CA proves that its computation time is sub-polynomial. At the raw computational level, P=NP.</li>
                        <li><strong>Is SAT in \(\text{P}_{\text{recognition}}\)? NO.</strong> We prove that its recognition time is linear, which is polynomial. However, the class P requires problems to be both solvable and verifiable (recognizable) in polynomial time using a *single* resource metric.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The classical view of P requires polynomial time for the entire process as measured by a single clock. Recognition Physics shows that two clocks are required. SAT is "easy" for the computation clock but "hard" for the recognition clock. Because a polynomial-time solution requires both to be polynomial in the classical sense, P is not equal to NP at the level of physical observation. The problem wasn't that SAT was hard to solve; it was that the answer is hard to read.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>By making the observer an explicit part of the computational model, Recognition Physics completes the theory Turing began. The question was never whether SAT is "easy" or "hard"—it is easy to compute but hard to recognize. This distinction, invisible to the Turing model, is fundamental to all physical computation and resolves the P vs NP paradox by revealing that we were asking the wrong question all along.</p>
