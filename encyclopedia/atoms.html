  <h2>Essence</h2>
  <p>Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of matter, consisting of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. They are the smallest units of elements, retaining the properties of those elements.</p>

  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>An atom is defined as the smallest unit of a chemical element, made up of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in orbitals.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
    <p>The structure of an atom can be described mathematically using quantum mechanics, where the position of electrons is represented by wave functions.</p>
  </details>

  <h2>In Plain English</h2>
  <p>Atoms are like tiny solar systems, where the nucleus is the sun and the electrons are the planets orbiting around it. They come together to form everything we see around us, from the air we breathe to the stars in the sky.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Understanding atoms is crucial for grasping the principles of chemistry and physics. They explain the composition of matter, the nature of chemical reactions, and the behavior of materials.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Atoms consist of a nucleus, which contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons that orbit the nucleus. The arrangement and number of these particles determine the atom's properties and its interactions with other atoms.</p>

  <h2>Key Properties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Atomic Number:</strong> The number of protons in the nucleus, defining the element.</li>
    <li><strong>Mass Number:</strong> The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.</li>
    <li><strong>Electron Configuration:</strong> The distribution of electrons among the atom's orbitals, influencing chemical behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
    <p>The behavior of electrons in atoms is described by quantum mechanics, particularly through the Schr√∂dinger equation, which provides a way to calculate the wave functions of electrons.</p>
  </details>

  <h2>Connections</h2>
  <p>Atoms connect to various fields, including chemistry, where they combine to form molecules, and physics, where their interactions are studied in particle physics and quantum mechanics.</p>

  <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
  <p>Falsifiable predictions related to atoms include the outcomes of chemical reactions, the stability of isotopes, and the behavior of atoms under different physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure.</p>

  <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <p>A common misconception is that atoms are indivisible. In reality, they can be split into smaller particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons) and can undergo various transformations in nuclear reactions.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <h3>What is the structure of an atom?</h3>
  <p>An atom consists of a nucleus at the center, made of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around it in defined energy levels.</p>

  <h3>How do atoms bond to form molecules?</h3>
  <p>Atoms bond by sharing or transferring electrons, forming chemical bonds that create molecules.</p>

  <h3>What determines the properties of an atom?</h3>
  <p>The properties of an atom are determined by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons, as well as their arrangement.</p>
