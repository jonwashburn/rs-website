                <h2>Why this constant matters</h2>
                <p>
                    A framework is <em>parameter‑free</em> when its laws and dimensionless numbers are fixed by proof, not tuned to fit data.
                    But any contact with the laboratory still requires <em>one</em> bridge from pure, unitless mathematics to meters and seconds.
                    In Recognition Physics that bridge is the <strong>Recognition Length</strong>, λ_rec — the spatial quantum of a single recognition hop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before λ_rec was derived from first principles, the framework’s logic fixed all <a href="/constants/">dimensionless</a> relations, but its dimensional displays were <em>anchored</em>
                    to an external constant (e.g. G). Deriving λ_rec internally was the final step that removed that last dependence. After this, every quantity shown here
                    descends from the eight axioms with <strong>no adjustable numbers</strong>.

                <h2>What “parameter‑free” really means</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No fit knobs.</strong> Functional forms and dimensionless constants follow from the ledger calculus. There is nothing to twiddle after you see the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>One bridge to units.</strong> You still need a single conversion between the dimensionless ledger and SI. In our presentation, that anchor is λ_rec.</li>
                    <li><strong>Over‑constraints.</strong> The same gap and curvature objects reappear across domains (α, spectra, cosmology), leaving no room for independent tweaks.</li>

                <h2>Two routes to λ_rec</h2>
                <h3>1) Early empirical anchoring (historical)</h3>
                <p>
                    In the development phase, we inferred a consistent micro‑length by comparing the framework’s global constraints to reality (stellar luminosity balance and vacuum energy density).
                    Those routes yielded the <em>same</em> λ_rec within a few percent and worked as sanity checks — but they left a philosophical loophole: an apparent external dial.
                </p>
                <h3>2) Axiomatic derivation (final)</h3>
                <p>
                    The loophole closes by extremising the <em>ledger cost</em> for a one‑bit recognition in a minimal causal diamond. Two additive pieces compete:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Bit cost:</strong> the unit ledger cost to store a single recognition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curvature cost:</strong> the geometric cost of the curvature packet induced by that recognition over a diamond of edge λ.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The balance condition “bit cost = curvature cost” fixes λ without reference to astronomy or cosmology. In SI units this yields a Planck‑scale length.
                </p>

                    <h3>Result (units restored)</h3>
                    <pre><code>λ_rec ≃ √(ħ G / c³)   (Planck length)
≈ 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m</code></pre>
                    <p style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
                        Remarks: A closely related normalisation appears if one averages the curvature packet over faces, introducing a factor of π in the denominator,
                        <code>λ_rec = √(ħ G / (π c³))</code>. We document both conventions; our baseline pages use the standard Planck form and track normalisation choices on the
                        <a href="/proofs.html">Proofs</a> page.

                    The full extremal argument is outlined in the technical note and will be formalised in Lean. See <a href="/papers/">papers</a> and the working draft.

                <ul>
