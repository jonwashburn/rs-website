# Cosmology Pipeline (ILG)

Outputs:
- Linear growth D(a,k) and P(k)
- Lensing suppression at ℓ≈1500 (~5%)
- σ8 prediction

Assumptions:
- A_s sets amplitude unless V0 is derived.

Deliverables:
- Equations to code → curves vs ΛCDM.
- Statement on A_s calibration (single external anchor) if V0 not derived.
