    <section class="essence">
        <h2>Essence</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant (H₀) is a crucial value in cosmology that describes the rate of expansion of the universe. It quantifies how fast galaxies are receding from us, indicating the dynamic nature of the cosmos.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="definition">
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant is defined as:</p>
        <div class="math-note">
            H₀ = v / d
        </div>
        <p>where <em>v</em> is the velocity of a galaxy moving away from us, and <em>d</em> is the distance to that galaxy. The current best estimate is H₀ = 70.6 km/s/Mpc.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="in-plain-english">
        <h2>In Plain English</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant tells us how quickly the universe is expanding. For every megaparsec (about 3.26 million light-years) away a galaxy is, it appears to be moving away from us at a speed of about 70.6 kilometers per second. This expansion rate is fundamental to understanding the size, age, and ultimate fate of the universe.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="why-it-matters">
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant is essential for determining the scale of the universe and understanding its evolution. It plays a critical role in cosmological models, including the Big Bang theory, and helps scientists estimate the age of the universe.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant is derived from observations of distant galaxies. By measuring their redshifts (the change in light frequency due to their motion away from us) and knowing their distances, astronomers can calculate the rate of expansion. The relationship between distance and velocity is linear, leading to the formulation of the Hubble law.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="key-properties">
        <h2>Key Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>H₀ is measured in kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).</li>
            <li>It reflects the expansion rate of the universe at the present time.</li>
            <li>Different methods of measurement (e.g., Cepheid variables, supernovae, cosmic microwave background) yield slightly different values, leading to the "Hubble tension."</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="mathematical-foundation">
        <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
        <div class="collapsible">
            <h3>Mathematical Foundation</h3>
            <p>The mathematical relationship that defines the Hubble constant is derived from the Friedmann equations of cosmology, which describe how the universe expands over time. The basic form is:</p>
            <div class="math-note">
                H = (1/a) * (da/dt)
            </div>
            <p>where <em>a</em> is the scale factor of the universe, and <em>t</em> is time.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="connections">
        <h2>Connections</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant connects to various areas in cosmology, including dark energy, the cosmic microwave background, and the large-scale structure of the universe. It is also linked to the concept of the observable universe and the age of cosmic structures.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="testable-predictions">
        <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
        <p>Future measurements of the Hubble constant may reveal discrepancies between local measurements (e.g., using supernovae) and those derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Such differences could indicate new physics beyond the current cosmological models.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="common-misconceptions">
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>A common misconception is that the Hubble constant is a fixed value. In reality, it can change over time as the universe evolves, and different methods of measurement can yield varying results.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="faqs">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h3>What is the current value of the Hubble constant?</h3>
        <p>The current best estimate is H₀ = 70.6 km/s/Mpc.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is there a discrepancy in Hubble constant measurements?</h3>
        <p>The discrepancies arise from different measurement techniques and assumptions about the universe's composition and expansion history, leading to the so-called "Hubble tension."</p>
