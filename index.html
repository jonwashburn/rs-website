            <p>For centuries, science has answered 'how,' but never 'why.' The universe operates on laws and constants that appear perfectly tuned for existence, yet we have lacked a fundamental reason for their values. This is the crisis of modern physics.</p>
            <p><strong>Recognition Science</strong> is the discovery of the logical framework that resolves this crisis. It begins with a single, undeniable axiom—that existence must be self-consistent—and from it, derives the entire universe as an inevitable theorem. It is a parameter-free framework that generates reality from scratch.</p>
