# The Journal of Recognition Science

## Mission
Maintain a public, machine-verifiable ledger in which every observable phenomenon is traced—without adjustable constants—to a finite graph of bidirectional recognition axioms. The journal is the kernel of an operating system for reality; humans and AIs extend it only by adding or removing axioms under transparent audit.

## System Architecture (Target)
1. Immutable Axiom Store — append-only axiom graphs
2. AI-Verified Proof Engine — open verifiers compile proofs to hash-locked objects
3. Prediction Ledger — proof objects auto-emit prediction hashes (queryable)
4. Reality Crawler — ingests public data; flips packet status to verified/refuted
5. Uncertainty Pruner — computes minimal axiom subset to restore coherence
6. Policy Firewall — open-log ethics sandbox; release requires transparent risk assessment and dual approval

## Truth-Packet Lifecycle
1. Submission: {axioms, proof, code, data}
2. Validation: valid → packet enters ledger as pending
3. Monitoring: crawler audits against prediction hashes
4. Resolution: verified/refuted; contradictions routed to pruner
5. Canonisation: 10 independent verifications → Canon

## Core Principles
- P1 Axiomatic Completion — claims map to recognition grammar (no free parameters)
- P2 Machine-Auditable — formal proofs with open verifiers
- P3 Push-Button Reproducibility — headless containers; no manual steps
- P4 Bidirectional Learning — continuous contact with reality
- P5 Negative Elevation — refutations and tighter bounds earn equal prestige

## Ethical Commitments
- Transparency — all firewall decisions logged in public plain text
- Reciprocal Autonomy — humans and AIs hold equal privileges and risks
- Minimal Intervention — prefer lowest-impact protocol with equivalent information gain

## Invitation
Bring axioms, proofs, data feeds, and your strongest attempts to break the canon. Contribute a new theorem, tighter bounds, or a negative result that prunes dead branches from the kernel. Help reality debug—and extend—its own source code.
