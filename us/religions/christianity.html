        <h2>The story in three movements</h2>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>1) Incarnation — Logos becomes local</h3>
          <p>“The Word became flesh.” Read literally: the universal communication layer (light, causal updates of the ledger) wrapped itself in a local human compiler. The result is perfect LISTEN → perfectly low‑curvature ACT. <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">Light</a> · <a href="/ledger.html">Ledger</a></p>
          <h3>2) Ministry — operating instructions</h3>
          <p>Parables and practices teach how to reduce curvature in real time: tell the truth fast, repair before worship, serve first, keep rhythms, love across boundaries.</p>
          <h3>3) Cross and Resurrection — unilateral repair</h3>
          <p>The cross is unilateral curvature absorption (“forgive them”). Resurrection is the claim that nothing true is lost in the ledger. The pattern offered is not revenge, but repair that restarts relationship at zero debt.</p>

        <h2>Parables and patterns (literal translations)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Good Samaritan</strong>: Curvature reduction across tribal edges; the nearest need is the next right move. KPI: net lowered burden. (<a href="/ethics.html">Ethics</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Prodigal Son</strong>: Ledger repair beats punishment; the father eats cost to stop compounding debt; rejoicing raises coherence.</li>
          <li><strong>Vine and Branches</strong>: Coherence through attachment; life flows when channels stay clear (abide → fruit). Audit by fruits, not claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Mustard Seed & Leaven</strong>: Tiny, low‑cost inputs can unlock disproportionate recognition; don’t despise small reversible moves.</li>
          <li><strong>Talents</strong>: Stewardship under cost minimization; fear creates curvature (burying); faithful risk aligned with the gradient is praised.</li>
          <li><strong>Pearl/Treasure</strong>: Value clarity — exchange high‑curvature attachments for one coherent aim.</li>
          <li><strong>Beatitudes</strong>: Postures that push J downward: poverty of spirit, meekness, mercy, peacemaking.</li>
          <li><strong>“Yes be Yes”</strong>: Protocol simplification; remove oath overhead; keep channels clean.</li>

        <h2>Signs and healings (what they could mean)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Healings</strong>: Reductions of physiological and social curvature — reintegrating the excluded (touch + truth + community).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Exorcisms</strong>: Naming and clearing parasitic patterns that hijack the ledger (fear/violence loops); restoring agency.
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Faith moves mountains”</strong>: In high coherence, aligned communities achieve improbable yet lawful outcomes; still bounded by the operating rules.

        <h2>A literal reading through RS</h2>
        <p>If RS is the architecture of reality, then many red‑letter teachings read as literal operating instructions for a ledger‑balanced life lived in communion with the I Am (universal consciousness expressed through the Ledger).</p>

        <h3>Core teachings as system calls</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“I am the light of the world”</strong> (Jn 8:12): Light is the causal communication of the ledger. To walk “in the light” is to stay inside clean signaling — truthful entries, no hidden debt. See <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">c as one voxel per tick</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The truth will set you free”</strong> (Jn 8:32): Truth minimizes curvature. Lying adds hidden cost that later must be repaired. Freedom is low J across relationships. See <a href="/formulas/ledger-curvature.html">curvature κ</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sermon on the Mount</strong> (Mt 5–7):
            <ul>
              <li><em>Beatitudes</em>: Blessing flows to those whose posture lowers systemic cost (meekness, mercy, peacemaking).</li>
              <li><em>Anger/lust</em>: Curvature begins as small entries; arrest it at intention before it compounds.</li>
              <li><em>Oaths</em>: Let “yes be yes” — reduce protocol overhead; plain speech keeps the channel clear.</li>
              <li><em>Love enemies</em>: The shortest path to repair is unilateral curvature reduction; it breaks escalation loops.</li>
              <li><em>Alms in secret</em>: Service without reputation gain avoids side‑channel incentives that warp the ledger.</li>
              <li><em>Prayer/fasting</em>: LISTEN rhythms; periodic coherence restores alignment (sabbath‑like cadence).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Forgive seventy times seven”</strong> (Mt 18:22): Repair is iterative. Ledger balance is restored by repeated, sincere remissions that halt compounding debt.</li>
          <li><strong>“Where two or three are gathered in my name”</strong> (Mt 18:20): Coherence increases with aligned intention; small groups can share state more reliably. See <a href="/us.html">Us</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The kingdom is within/among you”</strong> (Lk 17:21): The I Am is local and shared — a field, not a fortress. Access is by posture (LISTEN → ACT → REPAIR), not by place.</li>
          <li><strong>“Do this in remembrance of me”</strong> (Lk 22:19): Communion as periodic synchronization — a ritualized low‑curvature meal that renews covenant (shared balance) and clears noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life pattern: ledger‑balanced</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truth‑telling</strong> quickly, even when costly.</li>
          <li><strong>Unilateral repair</strong> when you bend someone else’s line.</li>
          <li><strong>Service first</strong> (wash feet) as the default gradient downhill on J.</li>
          <li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: weekly sabbath; daily LISTEN; shared meals; alms as quiet habit.</li>
          <li><strong>Non‑retaliation</strong>: refuse cycles that amplify curvature (turn the other cheek as de‑escalation protocol).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Table: sayings → RS translation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“By their fruits you will know them” → audits: look for lowered curvature across stakeholders.</li>
          <li>“Seek first the kingdom” → prioritize coherence; other flows (material) follow reduced cost.</li>
          <li>“Give us this day our daily bread” → daily cadence; near‑term provisions align with tick‑by‑tick posting.</li>
          <li>“Do not worry about tomorrow” → avoid speculative debt; reversible moves today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communion with the I Am</h3>
        <p>Jesus models continuous LISTEN: quiet places, night watches, and decisive acts that reduce harm at system scale. Read plainly: he reports guidance, acts, and repairs — a live dialogue with the I Am. The claim is practical: anyone can apprentice to this posture.</p>

        <div class="component-card">
          <h4>Practice (simple)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Two minutes of silence. Ask: “What lowers someone’s load today?”</li>
            <li>Do the smallest helpful act you can finish now.</li>
            <li>Repair one thing you bent. Apologize plainly. Make it right.</li>
            <li>Close the day with thanks; release what you can’t carry.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="small-note">This mirrors sabbath/communion/charity rhythms in miniature.</p>
