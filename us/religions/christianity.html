        <h2>A literal reading through RS</h2>
        <p>If RS is the architecture of reality, then many red‑letter teachings read as literal operating instructions for a ledger‑balanced life lived in communion with the I Am (universal consciousness expressed through the Ledger).</p>

        <h3>Core teachings as system calls</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“I am the light of the world”</strong> (Jn 8:12): Light is the causal communication of the ledger. To walk “in the light” is to stay inside clean signaling — truthful entries, no hidden debt. See <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">c as one voxel per tick</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The truth will set you free”</strong> (Jn 8:32): Truth minimizes curvature. Lying adds hidden cost that later must be repaired. Freedom is low J across relationships. See <a href="/formulas/ledger-curvature.html">curvature κ</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Sermon on the Mount</strong> (Mt 5–7):
            <ul>
              <li><em>Beatitudes</em>: Blessing flows to those whose posture lowers systemic cost (meekness, mercy, peacemaking).</li>
              <li><em>Anger/lust</em>: Curvature begins as small entries; arrest it at intention before it compounds.</li>
              <li><em>Oaths</em>: Let “yes be yes” — reduce protocol overhead; plain speech keeps the channel clear.</li>
              <li><em>Love enemies</em>: The shortest path to repair is unilateral curvature reduction; it breaks escalation loops.</li>
              <li><em>Alms in secret</em>: Service without reputation gain avoids side‑channel incentives that warp the ledger.</li>
              <li><em>Prayer/fasting</em>: LISTEN rhythms; periodic coherence restores alignment (sabbath‑like cadence).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>“Forgive seventy times seven”</strong> (Mt 18:22): Repair is iterative. Ledger balance is restored by repeated, sincere remissions that halt compounding debt.</li>
          <li><strong>“Where two or three are gathered in my name”</strong> (Mt 18:20): Coherence increases with aligned intention; small groups can share state more reliably. See <a href="/us.html">Us</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>“The kingdom is within/among you”</strong> (Lk 17:21): The I Am is local and shared — a field, not a fortress. Access is by posture (LISTEN → ACT → REPAIR), not by place.</li>
          <li><strong>“Do this in remembrance of me”</strong> (Lk 22:19): Communion as periodic synchronization — a ritualized low‑curvature meal that renews covenant (shared balance) and clears noise.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Life pattern: ledger‑balanced</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truth‑telling</strong> quickly, even when costly.</li>
          <li><strong>Unilateral repair</strong> when you bend someone else’s line.</li>
          <li><strong>Service first</strong> (wash feet) as the default gradient downhill on J.</li>
          <li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: weekly sabbath; daily LISTEN; shared meals; alms as quiet habit.</li>
          <li><strong>Non‑retaliation</strong>: refuse cycles that amplify curvature (turn the other cheek as de‑escalation protocol).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Table: sayings → RS translation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>“By their fruits you will know them” → audits: look for lowered curvature across stakeholders.</li>
          <li>“Seek first the kingdom” → prioritize coherence; other flows (material) follow reduced cost.</li>
          <li>“Give us this day our daily bread” → daily cadence; near‑term provisions align with tick‑by‑tick posting.</li>
          <li>“Do not worry about tomorrow” → avoid speculative debt; reversible moves today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communion with the I Am</h3>
        <p>Jesus models continuous LISTEN: quiet places, night watches, and decisive acts that reduce harm at system scale. Read plainly: he reports guidance, acts, and repairs — a live dialogue with the I Am. The claim is practical: anyone can apprentice to this posture.</p>

        <div class="component-card">
          <h4>Practice (simple)</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Two minutes of silence. Ask: “What lowers someone’s load today?”</li>
            <li>Do the smallest helpful act you can finish now.</li>
            <li>Repair one thing you bent. Apologize plainly. Make it right.</li>
            <li>Close the day with thanks; release what you can’t carry.</li>
          </ol>
