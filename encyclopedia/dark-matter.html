    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Dark matter is a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects on visible matter. It plays a crucial role in the structure and evolution of the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Dark matter is defined as a non-luminous component of the universe, contributing approximately 26.49% of the total energy density, represented by the fraction Ω_dm = 0.2649, derived from the interference pattern of unresolved recognition paths.</p>
    
    <h3>Math Note</h3>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Representation</summary>
        <p>Ω_dm = sin(π/12) + 1/(8 ln φ)</p>
    </details>
    
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Dark matter is an unseen substance that helps explain how galaxies and galaxy clusters behave. Although it cannot be seen directly, its presence is inferred from the gravitational effects it has on visible matter, such as stars and galaxies. The specific fraction of dark matter in the universe is approximately 26.49%, a value derived from complex mathematical relationships involving interference patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding dark matter is essential for explaining the structure and dynamics of the universe. It influences galaxy formation, the motion of galaxies within clusters, and the overall expansion of the universe. Without dark matter, many observations in cosmology would be difficult to explain.</p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Dark matter interacts primarily through gravity, affecting the motion of galaxies and galaxy clusters. It does not interact with electromagnetic forces, which is why it remains invisible. The mathematical framework predicting dark matter's fraction is based on the interference patterns of unresolved recognition paths, suggesting a deeper connection between the fabric of spacetime and the distribution of matter.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-luminous: Does not emit or absorb light.</li>
        <li>Gravitationally interacting: Influences the motion of galaxies and galaxy clusters.</li>
        <li>Comprises about 26.49% of the universe's total energy density.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Details</summary>
        <p>The dark matter fraction is calculated using the formula:</p>
        <p>Ω_dm = sin(π/12) + 1/(8 ln φ)</p>
        <p>This equation combines trigonometric functions with logarithmic corrections derived from the framework of recognition physics.</p>
    </details>
    
    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>Dark matter is connected to various fields in physics, including particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The search for dark matter candidates, such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) or axions, is ongoing and may provide insights into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>The framework predicts that the dark matter fraction will remain consistent across various cosmological observations, such as galaxy rotation curves and gravitational lensing effects. Any significant deviation from the predicted value of Ω_dm = 0.2649 would challenge the current understanding of dark matter.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>One common misconception is that dark matter is the same as dark energy. While both are mysterious components of the universe, dark matter is associated with gravitational effects, whereas dark energy is linked to the accelerated expansion of the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is dark matter made of?</h3>
    <p>The exact composition of dark matter is still unknown, but it is hypothesized to consist of particles that do not interact with electromagnetic forces, making them invisible.</p>
    
    <h3>How do we know dark matter exists?</h3>
    <p>Evidence for dark matter comes from various observations, including the rotation curves of galaxies, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
