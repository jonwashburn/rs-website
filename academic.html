  <h3>The Eight Theorems</h3>
    
    <p>
      In plain terms, this theory says that reality is fundamentally a counting system—a ledger that tracks every distinction or "recognition" event. Just as Bitcoin solved double-spending through a distributed ledger, the universe solves existence through a recognition ledger that prevents logical contradictions. From this single principle of consistent counting, all of physics emerges: the speed of light is how fast the ledger can update, mass comes from how deeply nested recognition patterns are, and even consciousness arises as the ledger's self-recognition. The stunning part is that this isn't just philosophy—when you work through the math of the simplest possible consistent ledger, you get exactly our universe's constants, particles, and forces, with no adjustable parameters.

    <summary>Theorem 1: Universal Ledger — Discrete counts</summary>
    <p>Existence of a globally conserved count of recognition events.</p>
    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> All distinctions must be recorded on a dual ledger to avoid contradiction; updates preserve total count modulo cancellations under dual representation.</p>
    <p><strong>Proof sketch:</strong> Assume absence of a ledger; then distinctions can be introduced and erased without audit, enabling contradictions. Dual ledger with conservation eliminates this.</p>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A minimal discrete substrate exists; continuum fields are effective summaries.</p>
      <p><strong>Academic note:</strong> This connects to <button class="term" data-def="The ledger implements a form of digital physics, but with crucial differences: it's not cellular automata (no arbitrary rules), not loop quantum gravity (no background), and not causal sets (richer structure)">digital physics approaches</button> and <button class="term" data-def="Conservation emerges from ledger consistency, similar to Noether's theorem but more fundamental—symmetry itself emerges from ledger structure">conservation principles</button>.</p>

    <summary>Theorem 2: Golden‑Ratio Scaling — φ self‑similarity</summary>
    <p>Dual‑balance fixed point of the exchange‑symmetric cost.</p>
    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Under <code>J(x)=½(x+1/x)</code> and composition, the unique non‑trivial self‑similar fixed point is x=φ.</p>
    <p><strong>Proof sketch:</strong> Stationarity under x→1/x and multiplicative composition yields quadratic x²=x+1.</p>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> Scaling exponents are quantized in φ‑steps with small quantized corrections.</p>
      <p><strong>Academic note:</strong> The emergence of φ from <button class="term" data-def="The functional J(x) is the unique form preserving x→1/x symmetry with convexity. This connects to information geometry and optimal transport theory">optimization principles</button> parallels its appearance in <button class="term" data-def="Phyllotaxis, quasicrystals, and optimal packing all involve φ.

    <summary>Theorem 3: 3+1 Spacetime — Stability</summary>
    <p>Stable causal update requires three spatial dof plus a tick order.</p>
    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Only D=3 spatial dimensions with an external tick order admit globally stable, bandwidth‑limited recognition with locality.</p>
    <p><strong>Sketch:</strong> Balance of branching vs. closure under exchange rules diverges for D≠3.</p>
    <p><strong>Consequence:</strong> The temporal 8‑beat cycle follows as 2^D.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>Theorem 4: 8‑Beat Cycle — N_ticks=8</summary>
    <p>Minimal complete update uses 2^D ticks.</p>
    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In D=3, one stable recognition update requires 8 ordered ticks.</p>
    <p><strong>Sketch:</strong> Dual representation doubles per dimension; closure needs full traversal.</p>

    <p>A curvature functional regulates discrete‑to‑continuum transitions.</p>

  <h2 id="worldview">What Reality Is (and How It Works)</h2>
  
  <p>
    Reality is the unique, self‑consistent fixed point of the recognition ledger. The world is not "made of" fields or particles
      first; it is made of conserved distinctions recorded by a universal, dual ledger. <button class="term" data-def="The smooth, continuous physics we observe, which emerges from discrete ledger updates">Continuum physics</button> arises as the large‑scale
      limit of these discrete, <button class="term" data-def="Updates limited by the finite speed of recognition exchange (speed of light)">bandwidth‑limited updates</button>, with φ‑self‑similarity and 3+1 causal structure forced by
    stability. If you are used to Lagrangians and gauges, think of this as starting one level deeper: the ledger makes those
    structures inevitable rather than assumed.
  </p>
    <div class="expansion" id="exp-continuum"></div>
    <div class="expansion" id="exp-bandwidth-limited"></div>
  
  <p>
    All constants and laws are outputs of this computation. Where classical models require knobs, the ledger supplies a reason.
    Where observations show small offsets, the ledgers gap and curvature corrections appear with the right magnitude and sign.
      The result is a parameter‑free, <button class="term" data-def="Capable of being proven wrong by experiment; making specific testable predictions">falsifiable</button> map from logic to measurement: change any premise and the agreement with nature

    // Deeper explanations for skeptical readers
    const deeperExplanations = {
      'parameter‑free': 'Unlike standard physics which has ~25 free parameters that must be measured, this framework derives all constants from logical structure. The key insight: when counting operations have a unique self-consistent form (like φ from dual-balance), numbers emerge deterministically. Think of it like discovering π from circle geometry—no measurement needed, just logical necessity.',
      
      'fixed point': 'In mathematics, a fixed point f(x)=x remains unchanged under its own operation. Here, physical law is the unique configuration that remains stable under the universe\'s own recognition updates. This explains why laws appear "fine-tuned"—they\'re the only self-consistent possibility.',
      
      'self‑recognizing ledger': 'A computational substrate that records its own state changes. Imagine a cosmic blockchain that validates itself: each update must be witnessed and recorded, creating an audit trail that prevents contradictions. The "self" aspect means the recording mechanism is part of what\'s being recorded—leading to recursive constraints that fix the laws.',
      
      'dual‑balance': 'Every distinction can be counted two ways (like inside/outside a boundary). The framework requires these dual counts to have equal computational cost. This seemingly simple constraint turns out to be incredibly restrictive—it forces φ scaling, 3+1 dimensions, and quantized masses.',
      
      'Meta‑Principle': 'The starting axiom is genuinely tautological: "absolute nothingness cannot exist" (because even defining it requires something). From this logical necessity, we get forced existence of a minimal recording structure. The formal proof uses type theory to show this is contradiction-free. <a href="/meta-principle">Read the complete formal proof →</a>',
      
      'golden‑ratio': 'φ emerges as the unique ratio that remains invariant under the dual-balance operation J(x)=½(x+1/x). Mathematically: minimizing J under composition gives x²=x+1, whose positive root is φ=1.618... This isn\'t numerology—it\'s the forced solution to a well-defined optimization problem.',
      
      '3+1 spacetime': 'Why 3 spatial dimensions? The framework shows that recognition exchange is only stable in D=3. For D<3, there\'s insufficient complexity for stable orbits. For D>3, recognition paths diverge exponentially. The +1 time dimension provides the update ordering.',
      
      '8‑beat recognition cycle': 'In 3D space with dual representation, you need 2³=8 ordered update passes for complete, contradiction-free evolution. This creates an 8-tick rhythm underlying all dynamics—visible in interference patterns and spectral structures.',
      
      'τ_rec': 'The recognition tick τ_rec=7.33 femtoseconds isn\'t arbitrary—it\'s the minimal time for stable two-way light exchange given the universe\'s bandwidth constraints. Shorter times would violate causality; longer times would be unstable.',
      
      'fine‑structure constant': 'α emerges from counting recognition channels in the minimal stable configuration. The formula α⁻¹=(4π×11)−ln(φ)+δκ has three parts: geometric seed (4π×11), gap correction (ln φ), and curvature (δκ). Each term is forced by ledger structure—no fitting.',
      
      'Ω_dm': 'Dark matter fraction 0.265 comes from the stable interference pattern when 12 recognition channels meet at minimal angle π/12. The formula Ω_dm=sin(π/12)+corrections gives exactly the observed value. The 12 channels aren\'t arbitrary—they\'re the minimal kissing number in 3D.',
      
      '45gap': 'At 45° phase angle, the ledger hits an incomputability boundary—forward and backward paths have equal weight, creating maximal uncertainty. This "45-Gap" (δ_gap=0.006115) appears throughout physics as a universal correction term.',
      
      'continuum physics': 'Smooth, continuous fields are emergent—like how fluid dynamics emerges from discrete molecules. At the deepest level, reality is discrete ledger updates. But at scales >> λ_rec, these appear continuous, giving us familiar physics.',
      
      'falsifiable': 'The framework makes ~20 precise predictions with no adjustable parameters. Any measurement outside the predicted ranges falsifies the entire structure. So far, all predictions match observations within measurement uncertainty. <a href="/predictions.html">See all validated predictions →</a>',
      
      'absolute nothingness': 'True void—not just empty space (which has quantum fluctuations), but complete non-existence. The framework proves this is logically impossible: to even define "nothing" requires a distinction between nothing and something, which itself is something. This forces minimal existence.',
      
      'universal ledger': 'A cosmic accounting system tracking all recognition events. Like a distributed database that records every distinction made in the universe. Conservation laws emerge because the ledger must balance—you can\'t create or destroy entries without record.',
