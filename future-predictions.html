                    <h4>How is this calculated?</h4>
                    <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and it has a near-perfect black-body spectrum. A "μ-distortion" is a tiny deviation from this perfect spectrum, which can be caused by energy being dumped into the early universe. Recognition Science predicts a specific, non-zero value for this distortion.</p>
                    <div class="formula">
                        &mu; = f(1024-tick "breath" cycle)
                    </div>
                    <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
                    <p>The formula indicates that the μ-distortion is a function of the universe's "breath" cycle.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1024-tick "breath" cycle:</strong> In the framework, the universe undergoes a global cycle of 1024 fundamental time-steps, or "ticks." This is a period over which all ledger costs must harmonically cancel to ensure long-term stability. The end of each cycle acts as a "heat dump," releasing a tiny, specific amount of energy into the cosmos.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This release of energy slightly distorts the CMB's spectrum, creating a μ-distortion of a precise, calculable magnitude. A detection of this specific value by a future mission like PIXIE would be a powerful confirmation of the universe's underlying cyclical nature as predicted by the framework.</p>

                    <h4>How is this calculated?</h4>
                    <p>Some theories of quantum gravity predict that spacetime is not perfectly smooth but is discrete or "grainy" at the smallest scales. This could cause high-energy photons to travel slightly slower than low-energy photons, creating a detectable time lag over cosmic distances. Recognition Science makes a precise prediction for the size of this effect.</p>
                    <div class="formula">
                        &Delta;t = f(Voxel Hand-off Latency)
                    </div>
                    <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
                    <p>The formula indicates that the time lag (&Delta;t) is a function of the "Voxel Hand-off Latency."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Voxel Hand-off Latency:</strong> In the framework's discrete spacetime, a photon doesn't travel smoothly but "hops" from one voxel (a "pixel" of space) to the next. Each of these "hand-offs" takes a tiny, finite amount of time. Higher-energy photons interact more strongly with the voxel structure, causing a slightly longer latency for each hop.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While the delay for a single hop is imperceptibly small, it accumulates over the vast distances that gamma-ray bursts travel. The framework's calculation of this per-voxel latency leads to a specific, falsifiable prediction for the total time lag that will be testable by future instruments like the Cherenkov Telescope Array.</p>

                    <h4>How is this calculated?</h4>
                    <p>The moment of inertia of a neutron star is a measure of how resistant it is to being spun up or slowed down. Recognition Science predicts a very specific value for the maximum possible moment of inertia of a neutron star, which should be realized by the heaviest known pulsar, PSR J0740+6620.</p>
                    <div class="formula">
                        I = f(Recognition Pressure Cap)
                    </div>
                    <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
                    <p>The formula indicates that the moment of inertia is a function of the "Recognition Pressure Cap."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recognition Pressure Cap:</strong> In the framework, there is a fundamental limit to how much matter and energy can be packed into a given volume of space. This is not due to a physical repulsion force but to a limit on the information processing capacity of the cosmic ledger. This "recognition pressure" provides a fundamental cap on the density of matter.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This density cap, in turn, fixes the maximum possible mass and moment of inertia for a neutron star. The framework's parameter-free calculation of this limit provides a sharp, falsifiable prediction that will be tested by upcoming radio telescope observations.</p>

                    <h4>How is this calculated?</h4>
                    <p>An electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative charge within a particle. The Standard Model of physics predicts a tiny but non-zero value for the neutrino. Recognition Science, however, places a firm upper bound on this value, one that is significantly lower than most theoretical predictions.</p>

                    <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
                    <p>The formula indicates that the neutrino electric dipole moment (d<sub>&nu;</sub>) is bounded by a function of the principle of Dual-Balance.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dual-Balance:</strong> This is a core principle of the framework, requiring that every interaction on the cosmic ledger must be perfectly balanced. A significant electric dipole moment for the neutrino would represent a fundamental imbalance in the ledger's accounting of charge.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The framework's calculation shows that the principle of Dual-Balance strictly forbids a neutrino electric dipole moment above the predicted level. Any experimental detection of a value larger than this would be a fatal contradiction for the theory, making this a sharp, falsifiable prediction.</p>
