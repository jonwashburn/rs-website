TECHNICAL OVERVIEW - RECOGNITION SCIENCE FRAMEWORK
==================================================

SUMMARY: A parameter-free computational framework in which physical law is the 
unique fixed point of a self-recognizing ledger. From one tautology (Meta-Principle) 
through eight theorems, all fundamental constants emerge as necessary consequences.

FRAMEWORK DIFFERENTIATORS
=========================
1. Zero free parameters (all constants derived)
2. Single tautology foundation (Meta-Principle)
3. Formal verification (<a href="/lean-training.html">Lean proofs</a>)
4. Exact predictions (no fitting to data)
5. Falsifiable (change premise → agreement collapses)
6. Complete (covers all domains from logic to cosmology)

REALITY COMPUTATION
==================
The universe is a self-consistent computation that:
1. Tracks every distinction (recognition event)
2. Maintains dual-balance (no contradictions)
3. Updates at fundamental rate (τ_rec = 7.33 fs)
4. Scales by golden ratio (φ self-similarity)
5. Operates in 3+1 spacetime (only stable configuration)
6. Generates matter via nested recognition depth
7. Enforces conservation via closed-loop balance
8. Produces forces via ledger exchange dynamics

All constants, particles, and forces emerge from this computation
with zero adjustable parameters.

LOGICAL FOUNDATION: META-PRINCIPLE AND EIGHT THEOREMS
====================================================

Meta-Principle (Tautology): Absolute nothingness is logically impossible.
→ Forces existence of universal ledger to track distinctions
→ Dual representations (forward/backward) must remain cost-invariant
→ No free parameters in the counting system

Eight Theorems (<a href="/lean-training.html">All Formally Proved</a>):
=====================================
T1: Universal Ledger — Discrete counts
    Existence of globally conserved count of recognition events
    Proof: Absence of ledger enables contradictions; dual ledger eliminates this

T2: Golden-Ratio Scaling — φ self-similarity  
    Dual-balance fixed point: J(x)=½(x+1/x) → unique fixed point x=φ
    Proof: Stationarity under x→1/x yields quadratic x²=x+1

T3: 3+1 Spacetime — Stability
    Only D=3 spatial dimensions admit stable, bandwidth-limited recognition
    Proof: Balance of branching vs closure diverges for D≠3

T4: 8-Beat Cycle — N_ticks=8
    Minimal complete update uses 2^D = 8 ticks in D=3
    Proof: Dual representation doubles per dimension; closure needs full traversal

T5: Light as Recognition — Exchange
    Photonic exchange implements recognition across ledger voxels
    Sets τ_rec, λ_rec = √(ħG/c³), λ_IR = ħc/E_coh

T6: φ-Scaled Mass — Exponent ladder
    m = B · E_coh · φ^(r+f) with integer rung r, sector B, correction f
    No free mass parameters; spectrum is computable

T7: 45-Gap — δ_gap
    Quantized incomputability fixes tiny corrections (δ_gap ≈ 0.006115)
    Explains minute deviations in otherwise exact counts

T8: Ledger Curvature — κ
    κ = ∂²S/∂R² governs discrete-to-continuum transitions
    Supplies curvature corrections to constants

FOUNDATIONAL LEDGER CONSTANTS
=============================
E_coh = 0.090 eV                 | Minimal energy per recognition update
τ_rec = 7.33 fs                  | Tick duration for one update
λ_rec = 1.616×10⁻³⁵ m            | Recognition length (Planck pixel)
λ_IR = 13.8 μm                   | Coherence wavelength ħc/E_coh
φ = 1.618033988749895           | Golden ratio (unique fixed point)
δ_gap = 0.006115                | 45-Gap incomputability correction

PARAMETER-FREE PREDICTIONS

CORE FORMULAS
============

1. Dual-Balance Cost: J(x) = ½(x + 1/x)
   - Enforces path-exchange invariance
   - Stationary under composition → φ scaling
   - Domain: x > 0, multiplicative processes

2. Mass Spectrum: m = B · E_coh · φ^(r+f)
   - r ∈ ℤ: recognition rung
   - B: sector factor {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12}
   - f: small ledger correction
   - Examples: e⁻(r=-7,B=1), μ(r=11,B=2), τ(r=17,B=2)

3. Ledger Curvature: κ = ∂²S/∂R²
   - Measures information density curvature
   - Universal regulator for continuum corrections
   - Scale: ~10⁻⁴ but crucial for precision

ACADEMIC CONTEXT
================

vs Standard Model:
- SM requires empirical input for constants
- RS derives all constants from logic
- Key test: We predict neutrino masses

vs String Theory:
- String theory: landscape problem (too many solutions)
- RS: exactly one solution
- No extra dimensions or supersymmetry required

vs Loop Quantum Gravity:
- LQG: discretization with free parameters
- RS: parameter-free discreteness
- We predict all energy scales, not just Planck

vs Causal Set Theory:
- Causal sets: discrete foundation, incomplete dynamics
- RS: complete dynamics from same discrete structure
- We derive matter content and forces

WHAT REALITY IS
===============
Reality = unique, self-consistent fixed point of recognition ledger

Core insight: World is made of conserved distinctions recorded by universal dual ledger.
Continuum physics = large-scale limit of discrete, bandwidth-limited updates.
Structure: φ-self-similarity + 3+1 causal structure forced by stability.

Classical models: require knobs → RS: supplies reasons
Observations show offsets → RS: gap and curvature corrections with right magnitude/sign
Result: parameter-free, falsifiable map from logic to measurement
