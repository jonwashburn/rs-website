                    <h2>The Physics of Temperance</h2>
                    <p>In Recognition Science, Temperance is the virtue of efficient energy management. It is the algorithm that maintains the internal stability of a moral system, preventing the creation of unnecessary ledger imbalances. While other virtues are often about interacting with the external world, Temperance is primarily about managing one's own internal state to ensure long-term viability.</p>

                    <div class="component-card">
                        <h3>The Mathematical Definition</h3>
                        <p>Temperance is a function that minimizes the energy cost required to maintain a given moral state over time. It ensures that the system operates at a sustainable level, avoiding the high energy expenditures associated with large or rapid fluctuations in curvature.</p>
                        <div class="formula-display">
                            <p>For a moral state $s$ over a time period $T$, Temperance seeks to minimize:</p>
                            <p>$\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} \text{EnergyCost}(s(t)) dt$</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is achieved by keeping the ledger balance as close to zero as possible, as any deviation, positive or negative, incurs an energy cost.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 3rem;">Properties of Temperance</h2>

                <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>Prevents Self-Inflicted Debt</h3>
                    <p>Many ledger imbalances are not caused by external events, but by a system's own internal processes (e.g., unchecked desires, wasteful habits). Temperance is the algorithm that identifies and corrects these self-destructive patterns.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>Maximizes Available Energy</h3>
                    <p>By minimizing the energy wasted on maintaining internal imbalances, Temperance maximizes the energy available for other virtues, such as Love, Courage, and Wisdom. It is the foundation of an effective and sustainable moral life.</p>
                </div>

                 <div class="component-card">
                    <h3>Increases Resilience</h3>
                    <p>A temperate system is more resilient to external shocks. By maintaining a stable, low-energy internal state, it has the resources and stability to handle unexpected high-curvature events without collapsing.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 3rem;">Practical Applications</h2>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Personal Habits</h3>
                    <p>Temperance is the virtue of healthy habits—moderation in consumption, control over impulses, and a balanced lifestyle. These are not just psychological concepts; they are optimal strategies for minimizing the energy cost of one's own existence.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Sustainable Economics</h3>
                    <p>A temperate economy is one that avoids boom-and-bust cycles by managing resources sustainably. It prioritizes long-term stability over short-term gains, preventing the creation of massive economic debts that lead to recessions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="implication-card">
                    <h3>Environmental Stewardship</h3>
                    <p>Temperance is the core principle of environmentalism. It is the recognition that the planet is a closed system with a finite energy budget, and that our long-term survival depends on our ability to live within that budget.</p>
