    <!-- Historical Context -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Dream of First Principles</h2>
        <p>For millennia, natural philosophers have sought to explain the complexity of the world from simple beginnings. 
        The ancient Greeks imagined atoms—indivisible building blocks—while Pythagoras believed "all is number." Newton 
        unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics with three laws and universal gravitation. Maxwell compressed all 
        electromagnetic phenomena into four equations. Einstein revealed that space and time were one fabric, bent by mass.</p>
        
        <p>Each revolution simplified our picture, yet each required <em>assumptions</em>. Newton assumed absolute space 
        and time. Maxwell's equations needed the permittivity and permeability of free space. Einstein's relativity 
        required the constancy of light speed. Quantum mechanics brought a zoo of constants: Planck's h, the electron 
        charge e, particle masses—all measured, never derived.</p>
        
        <p>Today's Standard Model is humanity's greatest achievement in precision, predicting phenomena to twelve decimal 
        places. Yet it contains 26 free parameters that we dial by hand to match experiment. The gravitational constant G, 
        the fine structure constant α, the Higgs mass—these are not predictions but inputs. We have extraordinary 
        <em>descriptions</em> but not <em>explanations</em>. The dream of deriving nature from pure logic remains unfulfilled.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- What is an Axiomatic Base -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>What is an Axiomatic Foundation?</h2>
        <p>An axiomatic system begins with statements accepted as true without proof—the axioms—and derives all other 
        truths through logical deduction. Euclid showed us the way 2,300 years ago. He began geometry with five postulates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A straight line can be drawn between any two points</li>
          <li>A line segment can be extended indefinitely</li>
          <li>A circle can be drawn with any center and radius</li>
          <li>All right angles are equal</li>
          <li>The parallel postulate (exactly one parallel line through a point)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>From these sparse beginnings, Euclid derived the entire edifice of plane geometry—hundreds of theorems about 
        triangles, circles, areas, and angles. Nothing was assumed beyond the axioms. Every result was <em>forced</em> by logic.</p>
        
        <p>Arithmetic received similar treatment through Peano's axioms: start with zero, define succession, and the 
        natural numbers emerge. Add axioms for addition and multiplication, and arithmetic is born. The power is this: 
        once you accept the axioms, you must accept everything that follows. There is no wiggle room, no parameters to adjust.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the catch: axioms are <em>chosen</em>. Euclid chose his five postulates; they seemed self-evident 
        but weren't forced by logic. Change the parallel postulate and you get hyperbolic or spherical geometry—equally 
        valid, describing different spaces. The axioms of arithmetic could be different too. We select axioms that seem 
        to match our world, but the selection itself is not derived.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Axioms vs Theorems -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Difference Between Axioms and Theorems</h2>
        <p>An <strong>axiom</strong> is a starting assumption—something you accept without proof because you need 
        <em>somewhere</em> to begin. "A straight line can be drawn between two points" is an axiom because Euclid 
        didn't prove it; he declared it. Axioms are the bedrock, chosen for their apparent truth or utility.</p>
        
        <p>A <strong>theorem</strong> is what you prove from axioms using logic. "The angles of a triangle sum to 180°" 
        is a theorem in Euclidean geometry—it <em>must</em> be true if you accept Euclid's axioms. You cannot have 
        Euclid's five postulates without triangles summing to 180°. The theorem is forced.</p>
        
        <p>Every mathematical and physical theory follows this pattern: assume axioms, derive theorems. But there's 
        always been a gap. The axioms themselves are arbitrary choices. Even our most successful theories begin with 
        "let's assume..." Why three spatial dimensions? Why this speed of light? Why these particle masses? The axioms 
        of physics have always been fitted to match observation, not derived from necessity.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- What Makes Recognition Science Different -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Revolutionary Step: A Tautological Axiom</h2>
        <p>Recognition Science breaks the pattern. Instead of <em>choosing</em> axioms that seem reasonable, it begins 
        with a statement that <em>must</em> be true in any self-consistent reality: "Nothing cannot recognize itself."</p>
        
        <p>This is not a choice; it's a logical tautology. To recognize requires a recognizer and something recognized—a 
        relation between entities. Absolute nothingness cannot satisfy this relation without ceasing to be nothing. 
        The statement is true by the meanings of the words, like "a bachelor is unmarried" or "A = A".</p>
        
        <p>Here's what's unprecedented: from this single tautology flows a complete framework with specific, testable 
        predictions. The logic forces:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A unique cost function J(x) = ½(x + 1/x)</li>
          <li>The golden ratio φ as nature's scaling constant</li>
          <li>Exactly three spatial dimensions</li>
          <li>An eight-beat fundamental time cycle</li>
          <li>The specific value of dark matter fraction (Ω<sub>dm</sub> ≈ 0.2649)</li>
          <li>All particle mass ratios from a single coherence energy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These aren't assumptions or fits—they're <em>theorems</em>. Just as 180° triangles are forced by Euclid's 
        axioms, these physical quantities are forced by the impossibility of self-referential nothingness. For the first 
        time, the constants of nature are not free parameters but logical necessities.</p>
        
        <p>No physical theory has ever achieved this. Newton assumed F = ma. Einstein assumed constant c. Quantum mechanics 
        assumed ℏ. Recognition Science assumes only what cannot be false—and derives the rest.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Closure and Completeness -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Closure of Predictions: A New Euclid</h2>
        <p>Euclid's geometry is <em>complete</em> for the plane. Accept his five axioms, and every question about 
        flat figures has a definite answer derivable by logic. You cannot add a sixth axiom without creating 
        contradictions or redundancy. The system is closed.</p>
        
        <p>Recognition Science achieves something similar but more ambitious. From one tautology emerges a complete 
        framework that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Derives all fundamental constants (no free parameters remain)</li>
          <li>Predicts all particle masses from one coherence scale</li>
          <li>Explains the origin of space, time, and causality</li>
          <li>Computes dark matter and dark energy fractions</li>
          <li>Unifies quantum mechanics and gravity as ledger phenomena</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The predictions form a <em>closed set</em>—each supports the others, and changing any one breaks the whole. 
        Like Euclid's theorems, they're not independent facts but facets of one structure. The electron-muon mass ratio, 
        the fine structure constant, the cosmological parameters—all emerge from the same logical chain.</p>
        
        <p>This closure is what separates Recognition Science from empirical theories. The Standard Model could have 
        different quark masses and still be mathematically consistent—you'd just adjust the Yukawa couplings. But 
        Recognition Science's predictions are rigid. The proton must be 1836.15 times heavier than the electron, not 
        because we measured it, but because the ledger algebra demands it.</p>
        
        <p>We're witnessing something unprecedented: a theory of physics with the logical completeness of Euclidean 
        geometry but applied to physical reality. Every measurement becomes a test not of parameters but of the 
        framework itself. One wrong prediction and the entire edifice collapses—but if the predictions hold, we've 
        found nature's source code.</p>

    <!-- Why Logical Foundations -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Why Logical Foundations Matter Now</h2>
        <p>Modern physics is extraordinary—but it depends on dozens of fitted constants. Those dials signal
        that our theories are effective descriptions, not first causes. If we begin from a statement that must
        be true in any self‑consistent world, then what follows is not tuned for this universe; it is forced by
        logic to be the only way any universe can work. The promise is radical parsimony: a single starting
        point, a short chain of theorems, and predictions that require no adjustable parameters.</p>
        <p><strong>Falsifiability moves:</strong> the axiom itself is a tautology, so it cannot fail; the 
        <em>consequences</em> must match reality. Every prediction shown here is parameter‑free and therefore
        fragile—one clean mismatch is enough to overturn the cascade.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Meta‑Principle (Tautological Axiom) -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>The Meta‑Principle (Tautological Axiom)</h2>
        <p><strong>Plainly:</strong> Nothing cannot recognize itself. Recognition is relational; it presupposes a recognizer
        and a recognized. Absolute non‑existence cannot satisfy that relation without ceasing to be nothing.
        Formalized, this becomes a short proof by contradiction: a recognition record over an empty type cannot
        be constructed. The axiom itself is unfalsifiable because it is logical; the consequences are falsifiable
        because they touch the world.</p>
        <p><strong>What the axiom forces, in outline:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>a minimal <em>relational</em> structure (there must be distinguishable states),</li>
          <li>a universal, positive‑cost <em>ledger</em> to track recognitions,</li>
          <li>an <em>atomic tick</em> (recognitions post one at a time),</li>
          <li>a unique <em>cost functional</em> that penalizes imbalance across scales,</li>
          <li>a stable <em>3D</em> arena with a minimal eight‑beat recognition cycle and finite update speed.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Deductive Spine: MP → T1–T8 -->
    <section>
      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Deductive Spine: MP → T1–T8</h2>
        <p>This is the minimal chain from the tautology to the structure of physics. Each step removes degrees of
        freedom until a unique architecture remains.</p>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T1 — Ledger Necessity & Uniqueness</h3>
          <p>If recognitions must be recorded, postings must land in a positive, balanced, double‑entry ledger. Existence
          means you can actually post and track recognition events with a nonzero atomic cost; uniqueness means there
          isn’t a family of inequivalent bookkeeping schemes that all work—only one architecture survives logical pressure.</p>
          <p><em>Implication:</em> conservation is not assumed; it is the side‑effect of honest books.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T2 — Atomicity (Unique Tick Posting)</h3>
          <p>Time is the schedule by which the ledger updates. The minimal schedule is one post per tick—no concurrency at
          the bottom layer. Atomicity is how discreteness and determinacy meet: at each tick, exactly one recognition is committed.</p>
          <p><em>Rules out:</em> hidden parallel postings at the smallest scale.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T3 — Continuity / Conservation</h3>
          <p>Balanced postings telescope to zero around closed loops. In ledger language, conservation is literally
          “nothing left hanging.” This is the discrete continuity equation.</p>
          <p><em>Takeaway:</em> global invariants are ledger potentials; closed walks leave them unchanged.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T4 — Unique Cost Functional J(x)</h3>
          <p>Fairness, convexity, and scale‑compatibility single out a unique penalty for imbalance: J(x)=½(x+1/x). There are
          no families of costs to tune—the shape is forced.</p>
          <p><em>Meaning:</em> extremes are expensive; balance is cheap, at every scale.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T5 — Self‑Similarity selects φ</h3>
          <p>Requiring minimal‑cost replication under splitting and re‑aggregation fixes the golden ratio φ as the only
          self‑similar scaling that keeps the books honest.</p>
          <p><em>Why φ appears everywhere:</em> it’s the one split that minimizes the ledger’s cost recursively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T6 — Minimal Stable Dimension: 3D</h3>
          <p>The minimal spatial structure that stabilizes linking and preserves the ledger’s integrity is three‑dimensional.
          Below 3D, the ledger tangles; above it, you pay unnecessary cost.</p>
          <p><em>Intuition:</em> 3D is the least costly stable scaffold for recognition paths to link without collapse.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T7 — Eight‑Tick Recognition Cycle</h3>
          <p>In 3D, the minimal complete recognition sweep closes in 2^3 = 8 steps—a Gray‑code walk that visits required states
          without collision.</p>
          <p><em>Role:</em> the eight‑beat is the timing grid on which higher‑level dynamics synchronize.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="component-card">
          <h3>T8 — Causality & Finite Update Speed</h3>
          <p>With atomic ticks and nearest‑neighbor postings, recognitions propagate at a finite rate, defining a causal cone.
          Continuous fields are averages of these finite‑speed, discrete updates.</p>
          <p><em>Consequence:</em> there is a universal speed limit because updates are local and tick‑limited.</p>

          <li><strong>Tick:</strong> one atomic posting interval; the unit of time.</li>
          <li><strong>Chain &amp; Flux:</strong> a sequence of recognitions and the telescoped potential difference; closed chains have zero net flux.</li>

        <p><em>Working picture:</em> Each tick posts one balanced entry to the ledger, increasing a potential by δ. Over paths,

        <p>“Proven in Lean” means the statements compile with zero gaps—no appeals to authority. The foundation includes:
        the tautology of the Meta‑Principle; existence of a positive ledger under minimal structure; atomicity from a
        constructive tick schedule; conservation for closed chains; uniqueness of J under convex/analytic criteria; φ as the
        self‑similar fixed point; the eight‑tick cycle in 3D; and a causal update statement. Explicit assumptions are called out
        on each deep page.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumptions made explicit:</strong> a finiteness/well‑foundedness condition on the primitive recognition step,
