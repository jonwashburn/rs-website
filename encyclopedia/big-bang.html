    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang represents the initialization of the universal ledger, marking the beginning of time and space as we understand them. It is characterized by the first tick of the universal clock, where the causal stride is defined as one voxel per tick, establishing the framework for all subsequent physical processes.</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <math-note>Big Bang = Initialization of the ledger; c = 1 voxel/tick</math-note>
    <p>The Big Bang is defined as the event that initiated the expansion of the universe, governed by the principles of the ledger, specifically the cost function <a href="/encyclopedia/the-ledger.html">J(x)</a> which drives the routing-pressure relaxation.</p>

    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang is not a singular point in space but rather the moment when the ledger began recording events in the universe. This event set into motion the expansion of space, where distances between points are defined by the causal stride of one voxel per tick. The universe's evolution is dictated by the cost function that minimizes the energy associated with these expansions.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding the Big Bang is crucial for grasping the origins of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics. It provides a framework for explaining how the universe transitioned from a state of high density and temperature to the vast, cooler cosmos we observe today. This understanding also informs our approach to cosmological phenomena such as cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure formation.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang operates under the principles of the ledger, where the initialization event is characterized by a routing-pressure relaxation that follows the cost function <a href="/encyclopedia/the-ledger.html">J(x)</a>. This function dictates how energy is distributed as the universe expands, ensuring that the expansion is both efficient and stable. The causal limit, defined as one voxel per tick, sets the maximum speed of information transfer and interaction within the universe.</p>

    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Initialization of the Ledger:</strong> The Big Bang marks the start of the ledger's recording of events.</li>
        <li><strong>Causal Stride:</strong> The speed limit of interactions is set at one voxel per tick.</li>
        <li><strong>Routing-Pressure Relaxation:</strong> The expansion of the universe is governed by the minimization of costs associated with energy distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Click to expand</summary>
        <p>The mathematical foundation of the Big Bang involves the cost function:</p>
        <math-note>J(x) = 1/2 * (x + 1/x)</math-note>
        <p>This function enforces the principles of fairness and balance in the ledger, ensuring that the expansion is efficient and adheres to the constraints of the universe's geometry.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang is intrinsically linked to several key concepts in cosmology, including <a href="/encyclopedia/8-beat-cycle.html">the 8-beat cycle</a> that governs the rhythm of the universe's expansion, and <a href="/encyclopedia/spacetime.html">spacetime</a> as a dynamic entity shaped by the ledger's entries.</p>

    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Falsifiable predictions arising from the Big Bang framework include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The precise measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which should exhibit specific patterns consistent with the ledger's initialization.</li>
        <li>The distribution of large-scale structures in the universe, predicted to follow the ledger's cost-minimization principles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>A common misconception is that the Big Bang represents an initial singularity or a point in space. In reality, it is the initialization of the ledger, with no physical point singularity involved. The expansion is a result of the ledger's operational rules rather than a singular event in a pre-existing space.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <p><strong>What happened during the Big Bang?</strong><br>
    The Big Bang was the initialization of the ledger, marking the start of time and space, where the universe began to expand and evolve according to the principles of cost minimization.</p>

    <p><strong>Is the Big Bang the same as the creation of the universe?</strong><br>
    Yes, the Big Bang signifies the moment when the universe began to take its current form, governed by the operational rules of the ledger.</p>
