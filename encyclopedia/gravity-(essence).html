    <p>Gravity is a fundamental force that governs the attraction between masses, shaping the structure and dynamics of the universe. It is essential for understanding the behavior of celestial bodies, the formation of galaxies, and the evolution of the cosmos.</p>
</section>

<section class="definition">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Gravity can be defined as the force of attraction between two masses, described mathematically by Newton's law of universal gravitation and later refined by Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
        <p>Newton's law states that the gravitational force \( F \) between two masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:</p>
        <p> \( F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \) </p>
        <p>where \( G \) is the gravitational constant.</p>
    </details>
</section>

<section class="plain-english">
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward one another. For example, it keeps us on the ground and causes apples to fall from trees. In space, it governs the orbits of planets around stars and the motion of galaxies. Understanding gravity helps us explain why the universe behaves the way it does.</p>
</section>

<section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Gravity is crucial for the formation and stability of structures in the universe, from planets to galaxies. It influences everything from the trajectory of spacecraft to the behavior of light around massive objects, leading to phenomena like gravitational lensing.</p>
</section>

<section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Gravity works through the interaction of mass. According to general relativity, massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, creating a curvature that affects the motion of other objects. This curvature is what we perceive as the force of gravity.</p>
</section>

<section class="key-properties">
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Gravity acts between all masses, regardless of their size or distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Attractive:</strong> It always pulls masses together, never pushes them apart.</li>
        <li><strong>Weak:</strong> Compared to other fundamental forces, gravity is relatively weak, which is why we don't notice it at small scales.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="mathematical-foundation">
    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>Mathematical Note</summary>
        <p>The mathematical foundation of gravity includes Newton's law of gravitation and Einstein's field equations, which describe how mass and energy influence the curvature of spacetime.</p>
    </details>
</section>

<section class="connections">
    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>Gravity is interconnected with several key concepts in physics, including <a href="/encyclopedia/spacetime.html">spacetime</a>, <a href="/encyclopedia/quantum-entanglement.html">quantum entanglement</a>, and the <a href="/encyclopedia/information-theory.html">information theory</a> that underpins our understanding of the universe's structure.</p>
</section>

<section class="testable-predictions">
    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Predictions related to gravity include the behavior of objects in free fall, the bending of light around massive objects, and the detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes.</p>
</section>

<section class="common-misconceptions">
    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>A common misconception is that gravity is a force that acts at a distance. In reality, it is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass that causes objects to move toward one another.</p>
</section>

<section class="faqs">
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between mass and weight?</h3>
    <p>Mass is the amount of matter in an object, while weight is the force exerted by gravity on that mass. Weight can change depending on the gravitational field strength, while mass remains constant.</p>
