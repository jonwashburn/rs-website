  <!-- The Dream of First Principles -->
  <section class="section" id="dream">
    <div class="container reading">
      <h2>The Dream of First Principles</h2>
      <p>For millennia, natural philosophers have sought to explain the complexity of the world from simple beginnings. The ancient Greeks imagined atoms—indivisible building blocks—while Pythagoras believed "all is number." Newton unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics with three laws and universal gravitation. Maxwell compressed all electromagnetic phenomena into four equations. Einstein revealed that space and time were one fabric, bent by mass.</p>
      
      <p>Each revolution simplified our picture, yet each required <em>assumptions</em>. Newton assumed absolute space and time. Maxwell's equations needed the permittivity and permeability of free space. Einstein's relativity required the constancy of light speed. Quantum mechanics brought a zoo of constants: Planck's h, the electron charge e, particle masses—all measured, never derived.</p>
      
      <p>Today's Standard Model is humanity's greatest achievement in precision, predicting phenomena to twelve decimal places. Yet it contains 26 free parameters that we dial by hand to match experiment. The gravitational constant G, the fine structure constant α, the Higgs mass—these are not predictions but inputs. We have extraordinary <em>descriptions</em> but not <em>explanations</em>.</p>
      
      <div class="big-idea">
        Until now. What if those 26 parameters aren't free at all? What if they're as forced as π in a circle?

  <!-- What is an Axiomatic Foundation? -->
  <section class="section alt">
    <div class="container reading">
      <h2>What is an Axiomatic Foundation?</h2>
      <p>An axiomatic system begins with statements accepted as true without proof—the axioms—and derives all other truths through logical deduction. Euclid showed us the way 2,300 years ago with five postulates:</p>
      
      <div class="postulates">
        <ol>
          <li>A straight line can be drawn between any two points</li>
          <li>A line segment can be extended indefinitely</li>
          <li>A circle can be drawn with any center and radius</li>
          <li>All right angles are equal</li>
          <li>The parallel postulate (exactly one parallel line through a point)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <p>From these sparse beginnings, Euclid derived the entire edifice of plane geometry—hundreds of theorems about triangles, circles, areas, and angles. Nothing was assumed beyond the axioms. Every result was <em>forced</em> by logic.</p>
      
      <p>Arithmetic received similar treatment through Peano's axioms: start with zero, define succession, and the natural numbers emerge. The power is this: once you accept the axioms, you must accept everything that follows. There is no wiggle room, no parameters to adjust.</p>
      
      <p>But here's the catch: axioms are <em>chosen</em>. Euclid chose his five postulates; they seemed self-evident but weren't forced by logic. Change the parallel postulate and you get hyperbolic or spherical geometry—equally valid, describing different spaces.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- The Difference Between Axioms and Theorems -->

      <h2>The Difference Between Axioms and Theorems</h2>
      
      <div class="concepts-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Axiom</h3>
          <p>A starting assumption—something you accept without proof because you need somewhere to begin. "A straight line can be drawn between two points" is declared, not proven.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Theorem</h3>
          <p>What you prove from axioms using logic. "The angles of a triangle sum to 180°" must be true if you accept Euclid's axioms. The theorem is forced.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>Every mathematical and physical theory follows this pattern: assume axioms, derive theorems. But there's always been a gap. The axioms themselves are arbitrary choices. Even our most successful theories begin with "let's assume..."</p>
      
      <p>Why three spatial dimensions? Why this speed of light? Why these particle masses? The axioms of physics have always been fitted to match observation, not derived from necessity.</p>

  <!-- The Revolutionary Step -->
  <section class="section alt" id="revolution">
    <div class="container reading">
      <h2>The Revolutionary Step: A Tautological Axiom</h2>
      
      <p>Recognition Physics breaks the pattern. Instead of <em>choosing</em> axioms that seem reasonable, it begins with a statement that <em>must</em> be true in any self-consistent reality:</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        Nothing cannot recognize itself.
      </div>
      
      <p>This is not a choice; it's a logical tautology. To recognize requires a recognizer and something recognized—a relation between entities. Absolute nothingness cannot satisfy this relation without ceasing to be nothing. The statement is true by the meanings of the words, like "a bachelor is unmarried" or "A = A".</p>
      
      <div class="big-idea">
        For the first time in physics, we begin with something that MUST be true—not something we hope is true.
      </div>
      
      <p>From this single tautology flows a complete framework with specific, testable predictions. The logic doesn't suggest or allow—it <em>forces</em>:</p>
      
      <div class="concepts-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Unique Cost Function</h3>

  <!-- The Eight Theorems -->
  <section class="section" id="theorems">
    <div class="container reading">
      <h2>The Chain of Necessity: Eight Theorems</h2>
      <p>From the impossibility of self-referential nothingness flows a cascade of logical consequences. Each theorem isn't a choice or assumption—it's forced. Like dominoes falling, each truth triggers the next.</p>
      
      <div class="theorem-timeline">
        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="theorem-number">T1</div>
          <h3>The Ledger Must Exist</h3>
          <p>If recognitions happen, they must be recorded somewhere. Not metaphorically—literally. The universe needs books. These books must be positive (you can't have negative existence), balanced (what goes up must come down), and double-entry (every action has an equal and opposite posting).</p>
          <div class="theorem-insight">Conservation laws aren't fundamental—they're just what happens when you keep honest books.</div>

        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="theorem-number">T2</div>
          <h3>Time is Atomic</h3>
          <p>The ledger can't update everything at once—chaos would reign. One recognition posts per tick, creating the heartbeat of existence. Time isn't continuous; it's the discrete drumbeat of ledger updates, one entry at a time.</p>
          <div class="theorem-insight">At the deepest level, the universe is turn-based, not parallel.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="theorem-number">T3</div>
          <h3>What Goes Around Comes Around</h3>
          <p>Walk any closed path through the ledger, and the books balance to zero. This isn't a choice—it's what "closed" means in ledger terms. Every conservation law, from energy to momentum, is just this principle wearing different masks.</p>

          <h3>The Universe's Cost Function</h3>
          <p>How does the universe penalize imbalance? Not arbitrarily. Demand fairness, convexity, and scale-compatibility, and only one function survives: J(x) = ½(x + 1/x). This unique shape makes extremes expensive and balance cheap.</p>

          <div class="theorem-number">T5</div>
          <h3>Why φ Rules Everything</h3>
          <p>When you split something and want the pieces to resemble the whole, while minimizing cost, only one ratio works: the golden ratio φ. It's not mystical—it's the unique fixed point where self-similarity meets efficiency.</p>
          <div class="theorem-insight">Nature's favorite number isn't arbitrary—it's the only one that makes recursive splitting sustainable.</div>

          <h3>Space Must Be Three-Dimensional</h3>
          <p>In fewer than three dimensions, recognition paths tangle and collapse. In more than three, you waste energy maintaining unnecessary structure. Three dimensions provide the minimal stable scaffold.</p>
          <div class="theorem-insight">We live in 3D not by accident, but because it's the cheapest stable configuration.</div>

          <h3>The Eight-Beat of Reality</h3>
          <p>In three dimensions, visiting all necessary recognition states takes exactly 2³ = 8 steps. This creates the fundamental rhythm of existence—an eight-tick cycle that all higher processes synchronize to.</p>
          <div class="theorem-insight">Complex phenomena emerge from this simple eight-beat, like symphonies from a conductor's tempo.</div>

          <h3>Nothing Travels Faster Than Light</h3>
          <p>With atomic ticks and local updates, information spreads one voxel per tick. This finite propagation speed isn't a mysterious constant—it's the inevitable result of discrete, local ledger updates.</p>

      <h2>Machine-Verified Truth</h2>
      
      <p>In mathematics, saying something is "proven" used to mean a human checked it. But humans make mistakes. That's why we've formalized these foundations in Lean 4—a proof assistant that acts as an infallible referee.</p>

  <!-- Where Logic Meets Measurement -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container reading">
      <h2>Where Logic Meets Measurement</h2>
      
      <p>A beautiful theory that doesn't match reality is just mathematics. But when logical necessity predicts measurable quantities—with no freedom to adjust—every measurement becomes a potential falsification.</p>
      
      <p>Take dark matter. Cosmologists measure it at roughly 26.5% of the universe's energy density. Recognition Physics computes it from the geometry of recognition on a 3D voxel lattice: Ω<sub>dm</sub> = sin(π/12) + 1/(8 ln φ) ≈ 0.2649. No fitting. No parameters. Just pure geometric necessity.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        Every prediction is parameter-free and therefore fragile—one clean mismatch and the entire edifice collapses.
      </div>
      
      <p>The framework predicts all particle masses from a single coherence energy E<sub>coh</sub> = φ<sup>-5</sup>. The electron-muon mass ratio, the strange quark mass, the W and Z boson masses—all emerge from the same formula: m = B·E<sub>coh</sub>·φ<sup>r+f</sup>, where B is a sector factor, r is an integer radius, and f is computed from the dispersion.</p>
      
      <p>These aren't retroactive fits. They're pre-registered predictions from a rigid logical structure. Change any piece, and the whole framework fails. That's the power—and the risk—of building from necessity rather than observation.</p>
