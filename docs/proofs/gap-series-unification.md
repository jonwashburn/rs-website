# Gap-Series Unification

Use only F(z)=ln(1+z/φ) with g_m=(−1)^{m+1}/(m φ^m) for all corrections.

Tasks:
- Define f_gap, f_tot precisely and map where each appears (α, masses, g−2).
- Remove/replace any ad-hoc series; ensure identical coefficients across domains.

Deliverable: dependency diagram and reference implementation snippet.
