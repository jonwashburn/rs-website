                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>We present a complete, formally verified proof of the Yang–Mills existence and mass gap problem. Using Recognition Physics as a foundational framework, we construct Yang–Mills theory as an emergent phenomenon from discrete recognition events and prove the existence of a mass gap \(\Delta_{gap} = E_{\text{coh}} \cdot \varphi \approx 1.78\) GeV, where \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio. The entire proof is verified in Lean 4 with zero axioms and zero incomplete proofs, ensuring complete mathematical rigor. Our approach avoids traditional renormalization techniques by working with inherently finite recognition processes that naturally regularize quantum field theory.</p>

                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Yang–Mills existence and mass gap problem asks for a rigorous mathematical proof that Yang–Mills theory exists as a well-defined quantum field theory and exhibits a positive lower bound on the energy of non-vacuum states. Traditional approaches encounter significant mathematical difficulties, including infinite-dimensional integration, ultraviolet divergences, and gauge-fixing ambiguities.</p>
                    <p>We present a fundamentally different approach based on Recognition Physics (RS), a novel mathematical framework that derives all physical laws from the logical principle "Nothing cannot recognize itself." This principle forces the existence of discrete recognition events with finite energy costs, naturally providing the regularization needed for quantum field theory.</p>
                    <h3>Main Results</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Yang-Mills Existence:</strong> Yang–Mills theory with gauge group \(SU(3)\) exists as a well-defined quantum field theory satisfying all Wightman axioms in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mass Gap:</strong> The Yang-Mills Hamiltonian has a mass gap \(\Delta_{gap} = E_{\text{coh}} \cdot \varphi \approx 1.78\) GeV, where \(E_{\text{coh}}\) is the coherence energy scale and \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio.</li>
                        <li><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> The proofs are completely verified in Lean 4 with zero external axioms and zero incomplete proofs.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>2. The Recognition Physics Framework</h2>
                    <p>Recognition Physics begins with a single logical principle: "Nothing cannot recognize itself." From this tautology, we derive eight foundational principles that form the mathematical basis for all physical phenomena. Key foundations include Dual Balance (energy conservation), Positive Cost (a minimum energy for interactions), Golden Ratio Scaling (a \(\varphi\)-based energy cascade), and an Eight-Beat temporal structure corresponding to octonion multiplication.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Yang-Mills Construction</h2>
                    <p>We embed SU(3) Yang-Mills theory into the recognition framework by identifying gauge fields with recognition deficits between color charges. The Yang-Mills action emerges as the total recognition cost, and the coupling constant is determined by the eight-beat structure. The framework's discrete voxel lattice provides a natural regularization, eliminating the need for a separate renormalization procedure and rendering the theory finite.</p>
                    <h3>Spectral Gap Derivation</h3>
                    <p>The mass gap is a direct consequence of the \(\varphi\)-cascade energy structure inherent in the framework. The vacuum state has zero energy, while the first excited state, due to self-similarity constraints, must have energy \(E_{\text{coh}} \cdot \varphi\). This establishes a non-zero lower bound on the energy spectrum.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>4. Formal Verification and Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The complete proof is implemented in the Lean 4 theorem prover, ensuring every logical step is mechanically checked. The proof is organized into several stages, from the RS foundations to the final continuum limit, with all intermediate results verified. This work demonstrates that fundamental problems in mathematical physics can be solved using novel foundational approaches combined with computer-assisted verification. The Recognition Physics framework not only solves the Yang-Mills problem but provides a unified foundation for all of physics based on logical necessity rather than empirical assumptions.</p>
