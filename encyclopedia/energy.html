  <h2>Essence</h2>
  <p>Energy is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the capacity to perform work or produce change. It is a conserved quantity, meaning that the total energy in a closed system remains constant over time.</p>

  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <div class="math-note">
    <p>Energy can be defined mathematically in various forms, such as kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE):<br>
    KE = \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\)<br>
    PE = \(mgh\)</p>
  </div>

  <h2>In Plain English</h2>
  <p>Energy is what allows things to happen. When you push a swing, you are using energy to make it move. Energy comes in different forms, like the energy in food that fuels our bodies, or the energy in gasoline that powers cars. No matter what form it takes, energy can change from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Understanding energy is crucial because it governs all physical processes. From the smallest particles to the largest galaxies, energy interactions dictate how matter behaves. This understanding allows us to harness energy for various applications, from electricity generation to transportation and beyond.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>Energy works through interactions between objects. For example, when you lift an object, you are transferring energy to it in the form of gravitational potential energy. When you drop it, that potential energy converts to kinetic energy as it falls. The principle of conservation of energy states that in an isolated system, the total energy remains constant, even as it changes forms.</p>

  <h2>Key Properties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.</li>
    <li><strong>Forms:</strong> Energy exists in various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, and nuclear energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Energy can be transferred between systems or converted from one form to another.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
  <div class="collapsible">
    <h3>Mathematical Foundation</h3>
    <p>Energy is often quantified using the following equations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kinetic Energy: KE = \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\)</li>
      <li>Potential Energy: PE = \(mgh\)</li>
      <li>Work-Energy Principle: Work = Change in KE</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Connections</h2>
  <p>Energy is interconnected with various concepts in physics, such as momentum, force, and thermodynamics. For instance, the work-energy theorem relates the work done on an object to its change in kinetic energy. In thermodynamics, energy transfer is a key factor in understanding heat and work interactions.</p>

  <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
  <p>Predictions related to energy conservation can be tested through experiments. For example, measuring the energy before and after a collision can confirm that energy is conserved, even as it transforms between kinetic and potential forms.</p>

  <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <p>A common misconception is that energy can be created or destroyed. In reality, energy can only change forms. For example, when burning fuel, chemical energy is transformed into thermal energy and light, but the total amount of energy remains constant.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <h3>What is energy?</h3>
  <p>Energy is the capacity to do work or produce change in a system.</p>

  <h3>Can energy be created or destroyed?</h3>
  <p>No, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.</p>

  <h3>What are the different forms of energy?</h3>
  <p>Energy can exist in various forms, including kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, and nuclear energy.</p>
