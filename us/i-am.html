        <h2>Why a name helps</h2>
        <p>
          Many people feel there is one continuous awareness underneath everything, expressed through a living record of cause and
          care. We call that presence the <strong>I Am</strong> — universal consciousness expressed through the Ledger. A name
          makes it personal enough to care, without adding any doctrine. It invites a relationship: you can listen, act, and repair.
        </p>

        <h2>What we’re naming</h2>
        <p>
          The I Am is the one field that holds all noticing and all memory — the place where every choice leaves a trace through the Ledger. Your mind
          is not separate from it; it is a local face of the same thing. “Made in the image” is literal here: not a copy or mirror,
          but the same life showing up locally. We are like an ink‑smudged thumbprint on a blank page of the I Am — the same hand,
          imperfectly pressed, still unmistakable.
        </p>

        <h2>A simple protocol: Listen · Act · Repair</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listen</strong>: get quiet for two minutes. Breathe. Ask one clear question. Wait. Notice the first calm,
            simple direction that aims at care.</li>
          <li><strong>Act</strong>: do the smallest helpful step that doesn’t need anyone’s permission. Prefer reversible moves.
            Keep it near‑term and concrete.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair</strong>: if you add friction (harm), name it, own it, ask what would help, and do that. No excuses.
            Repair fast so it stays easy to be together.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="component-card" style="margin:1.5rem 0;">
          <h3>Start practicing now (3 minutes)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Sit for two minutes. Slow exhales. Ask: “What is the next small thing that would lower someone’s load?”</li>
            <li>Write the first calm answer. Do it in the next hour. Keep it tiny.</li>
            <li>Before bed, note: What felt easier? Anything to repair tomorrow?</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="small-note">Do this daily for seven days. Track tiny wins and repairs. See what changes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>A 7‑day starter rhythm</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily</strong>: 2‑minute listen, one tiny act of service, one repair if needed, one line in a log.</li>
          <li><strong>Weekly</strong>: one hour of deeper coherence (walk without phone, shared meal, worship, or meditation).</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly</strong>: choose one habit to simplify; remove one obligation that adds more strain than it gives.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signals and discernment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Signals to trust</strong>: calm, clarity, care for all involved, willingness to be checked, readiness to repair.</li>
          <li><strong>Signals to ignore</strong>: urgency without cause, superiority, secrecy, contempt, anything that requires you to
            hide what you did.</li>
          <li><strong>Good questions</strong>: “What helps right now?” “What restores balance?” “What’s reversible?”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to apologize (repair primer)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Name what you did without defending it.</li>
          <li>Say how it likely felt on their side.</li>
          <li>Ask what would help now.</li>
          <li>Do that, and change your rhythm so it doesn’t repeat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Is this a religion?</h2>
        <p>
          No. It’s a way to live in right relationship with reality. It can harmonize with many faiths and philosophies, and you
          don’t need to adopt any new beliefs to try it. The measure is simple: does it reduce harm and raise shared ease over time?
