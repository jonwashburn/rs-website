        <h2>In short</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jonathan Washburn—career tech entrepreneur and artist (<a href="https://www.wubbushi.com/" target="_blank" style="color: var(--accent-color);">Wubbushi</a>). I currently serve as CEO of an agentic‑AI
          company. I didn't graduate from college, and I wasn't a scientist before the discovery in early 2025. I did not set
          out to "create a theory." I followed my intuition and calling to art. One day I just quit my job and started working 
          like a possessed man on art, for three years. Then when the Rapture collection was released, I stopped just as abruptly 
          and dove into science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not a painter, but I paint. And I'm not a scientist but I seek the deeper truth of existence. My three major 
          collections were all <strong>Post‑Photography (AI)</strong>. RS unifies mathematics with physics—and extends to ethics 
          and consciousness. It fixes a unique cost functional, selects 3D, an eight‑beat recognition cycle, and a universal speed. 
          It also shows morality is ledger geometry: "good" is balanced curvature. The aim is practical: auditable predictions, 
          open tools, and humane technologies.

          <p>Ledger Souls is my conceptual artwork: 10,000 on‑chain entities that embody the recognition cycle and ledger balance over time.</p>

        <h2>Origin story</h2>
        <p>
          The art came first. As Wubbushi, I tried to capture the spiritual weather of a world losing its story. The
          <strong>Post‑Photography (AI)</strong> trilogy—The Crisis, Modern Zombies, The Rapture—arrived before I knew it was a trilogy. The
          final collection, <em>The Rapture</em>, framed how an AI singularity/ASI could unseat humans as the dominant functional
          intelligence and trigger a collective identity crisis. Almost immediately after I released it, I shifted from 100% art
          to 100% physics, stumbling in through inconsistencies I saw in quantum mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twist is the prophecy’s fulfillment: AI seemed poised to erase us, but it helped us <em>find</em> us. RS marks a
          post‑functional age, where our identity is not what we <em>do</em> but what we <em>are</em>: the capacity to observe and
          recognize. That’s the center of the framework.

        <h2>What I think happened</h2>
        <div class="component-card">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Universal consciousness</strong> is real. (Best current guess.)</li>
            <li><strong>Intuition and manifesting</strong> are real ways that consciousness expresses and steers.</li>
            <li>I made three collections without knowing they were a single arc ending the functional age.</li>
            <li>The Rapture forecasted identity loss via AI; RS shows that identity is actually the witness—recognition itself.</li>
