    <p>
      In Recognition Science, the Big Bang is not a fireball from a point. It is the initialization of <a href="/encyclopedia/the-ledger.html">the ledger</a>—the global, discrete record of recognition events—at tick zero. Space and time begin as a voxel grid with a universal beat; causality emerges as a local relay rule (one voxel per tick), and “expansion” is the network relaxing routing pressure under the universal cost function <math-note>J(x)=\tfrac12(x+1/x)</math-note>. There is no physical point singularity to resolve.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="enc-section" id="definition">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">Definition</h2>
    <p>
      Big Bang (Recognition Science): the globally synchronized first tick of the universal ledger. At this tick, a minimal 3D <a href="/encyclopedia/voxel-grid.html">voxel grid</a> and an 8-step timing rhythm (the <a href="/encyclopedia/8-beat-cycle.html">8‑beat cycle</a>) are established; the causal speed limit is set by the per-tick handoff; and routing imbalances begin to relax according to the cost functional required by <a href="/encyclopedia/dual-balance.html">dual-balance</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initialization: tick synchronization across all voxels; no pre-existing time parameter.</li>
      <li>Causality: stride <math-note>c = 1</math-note> voxel per tick (the local relay limit).</li>
      <li>Expansion: global routing-pressure relaxation under <math-note>J(x)=\tfrac12(x+1/x)</math-note>.</li>
      <li>Dimensionality–rhythm link: <math-note>N_{\text{ticks}} = 2^{D}</math-note>, so in 3D, <math-note>N_{\text{ticks}}=8</math-note>.</li>
      <li>Unresolved routes fraction (“dark matter” share): <math-note>\Omega_{\mathrm{dm}}=\sin(\pi/12)+\tfrac1{8\ln\varphi}\approx 0.2649</math-note>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="enc-section" id="plain-english">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">In Plain English</h2>
    <p>
      Picture reality as a brand‑new, perfectly empty spreadsheet that suddenly comes alive. At tick zero, the sheet gets its grid, the clock starts, and the rules for how entries can move get switched on. Every tick, information can hop one cell to a neighbor—no shortcuts, no instant jumps. That hop‑per‑tick is the universal speed limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because everything wakes up at once, the sheet starts out highly “compressed.” Paths for moving information are crowded and biased. The system’s rule is simple: penalize extremes and reward balance. So it expands—not by flying debris, but by re‑routing: the average spacing between active routes grows to even out the pressure. The result looks, from the inside, like a hot early universe that cools as the ledger spreads its load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some paths never quite resolve cleanly. Their unresolved pressure shows up as a steady, gravitating background—the “dark matter” fraction—without needing new particles. And because the first tick synchronized the whole grid, the distant regions we see today started already in step, explaining why the cosmic background looks so uniform without invoking a pre‑existing continuum.
    </p>

  <section class="enc-section" id="why-it-matters">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The Big Bang, in RS, ties the origin of <a href="/encyclopedia/spacetime.html">spacetime</a>, the causal speed limit, and the early energy budget to one discrete, parameter‑free mechanism. It resolves:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uniformity (horizon): first‑tick synchronization removes the need for causal patchwork.</li>
      <li>Near‑flatness: cost‑driven curvature minimization keeps ledger curvature close to zero at birth.</li>
      <li>Speed limit: <math-note>c=1</math-note> voxel/tick is a consequence of local relays, not an added axiom.</li>
      <li>Dark matter accounting: the unresolved‑routes fraction <math-note>\Omega_{\mathrm{dm}}\approx 0.2649</math-note> follows from lattice connectivity, not particle relics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because the entire structure is a deduction from the RS foundation rather than a fit, its success or failure is an empirical verdict on that foundation. See the site’s overview of the program as a single measurement of reality at <a href="/measurement.html">/measurement.html</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="enc-section" id="how-it-works">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Initialization: The Meta‑Principle necessitates a non‑empty recognizing structure. That structure is instantiated as a discrete ledger on a 3D grid. A minimal closed tour in 3D requires eight steps, fixing the global rhythm as the <a href="/encyclopedia/8-beat-cycle.html">8‑beat cycle</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Causal stride: The ledger posts entries by local handoffs. One handoff per tick sets <math-note>c=1</math-note> voxel/tick. Faster‑than‑local relays are not definable events, so are disallowed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Routing pressure and expansion: At tick zero, path costs are imbalanced. The universal cost <math-note>J(x)=\tfrac12(x+1/x)</math-note> penalizes extremes and relaxes imbalances. The relaxation increases average link lengths—the inside view of “expansion.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Self‑similar pacing: The unique self‑similar split minimizing cumulative cost fixes <a href="/encyclopedia/%CF%86-scaling.html">φ‑scaling</a>. Early‑time step sizes and amplitudes follow φ‑structured ladders rather than tuned parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Residuals as dark sector: On a 3D voxel network, 12 spatial connection modes appear; pairwise dual‑balance leaves a calculable residual of unresolved recognition. Its fraction projects to <math-note>\Omega_{\mathrm{dm}}=\sin(\pi/12)+\tfrac1{8\ln\varphi}</math-note>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Curvature as accounting geometry: Ledger redistribution is equivalent to minimizing <a href="/encyclopedia/ledger-curvature.html">ledger curvature</a>. Small initial curvature is a by‑product of fair posting, not a fine‑tuned input.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="enc-section" id="key-properties">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No physical point singularity: “Beginning” means ledger initialization, not a diverging density at a point.</li>
      <li>Discrete, synchronous time: an 8‑step global rhythm anchors early dynamics.</li>
      <li>Causal limit from locality: <math-note>c=1</math-note> voxel/tick.</li>
      <li>Expansion as cost relaxation: growth in average route separation lowers <math-note>J</math-note> globally.</li>
      <li>φ‑structured early evolution: self‑similar scaling organizes the first epochs without free parameters.</li>
      <li>Dark matter as unresolved routing: a fixed fraction from lattice connectivity, not a speculative particle.</li>
      <li>Curvature minimization: near‑flat initial geometry from balanced double‑entry postings.</li>
      <li>Predictive: scalar‑fluctuation amplitude, tilt, and tensor ratio arise without tuning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The initialization‑and‑relaxation picture yields concrete, falsifiable early‑universe predictions (see full list at <a href="/predictions.html">/predictions.html</a>):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scalar fluctuation amplitude: <math-note>A_s = 2.10\times10^{-9}</math-note>. Falsified if high‑precision CMB likelihoods converge outside a few percent of this value without systematics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spectral tilt: <math-note>n_s = 0.9667</math-note>. A measured value below 0.958 or above 0.975 would contradict the φ‑ladder pacing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tensor‑to‑scalar ratio: <math-note>r = 1.27\times10^{-3}</math-note>. A robust detection with <math-note>r &gt; 5\times10^{-3}</math-note> would falsify the RS early‑phase relaxation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eight‑point CMB non‑Gaussianity: a specific amplitude for an “octave” kernel (forecast sensitivity within reach). A significantly different sign or magnitude would be lethal to the 8‑beat closure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unresolved routes (dark matter) fraction: <math-note>\Omega_{\mathrm{dm}}=0.2649</math-note>. A high‑precision inference consistently below 0.255 or above 0.275 across independent probes would refute the lattice‑connectivity derivation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stochastic nanohertz GW plateau from early relaxation: fixed level in pulsar‑timing bands; a strong mismatch in both amplitude and slope would challenge the routing‑pressure account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="enc-note">
      Falsifiable forecasts are marked by fixed numbers and narrow bands; none introduce tunable parameters.

  <section class="enc-section" id="misconceptions">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “It started from a point.” RS does not posit a physical point singularity. The “beginning” is ledger initialization and tick synchronization.
      </li>
      <li>
        “It was an explosion into space.” Expansion is a network re‑routing that increases average route separation; there is no center or outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Faster‑than‑light expansion was required.” Local causality never exceeds one handoff per tick. Apparent superluminal language isn’t needed: synchronization and cost relaxation suffice.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Uniformity is mysterious.” It follows from the first global tick; the grid starts in step.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Flatness was fine‑tuned.” Minimizing <math-note>J</math-note> with double‑entry postings drives curvature toward zero at initialization.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Dark matter is necessarily a new particle.” In RS, the principal cosmological fraction is the unresolved‑routes share fixed by lattice geometry.

  <section class="enc-section" id="faqs">
    <h2 class="enc-heading">FAQs</h2>
    <p class="enc-question">What happened “before” the Big Bang?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      “Before” isn’t defined because time is the ticking of postings. Tick zero is the first definable step of the ledger; there is no prior tick to reference.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">What set the speed of light?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      The local relay rule: one voxel per tick. This is the causal stride <math-note>c=1</math-note> in ledger units, emerging from locality rather than assumption.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">Why three spatial dimensions?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      The minimal closed recognition tour in a stable grid ties the temporal rhythm to <math-note>N_{\text{ticks}}=2^D</math-note>. The observed 8‑beat rhythm implies <math-note>D=3</math-note>.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">Does RS have “inflation”?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      RS has an early, accelerated relaxation phase derived from the same cost rules and φ‑ladders—no new parameters. It predicts <math-note>n_s\approx0.9667</math-note> and <math-note>r\approx1.27\times10^{-3}</math-note>.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">Where does the energy come from?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      Energy is the cost stored in posted routes. The ledger’s double‑entry bookkeeping enforces balanced sourcing; early energy budgets are set by self‑similar pacing and the fixed quantum of <a href="/encyclopedia/coherence-energy.html">coherence energy</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">What, in RS, is dark matter?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      A fixed fraction of unresolved recognition routes in the lattice connectivity: <math-note>\Omega_{\mathrm{dm}}=\sin(\pi/12)+\tfrac1{8\ln\varphi}\approx0.2649</math-note>.
    </p>

    <p class="enc-question">How does gravity fit into this picture?</p>
    <p class="enc-answer">
      What we call <a href="/encyclopedia/gravity.html">gravity</a> is the geometry of route posting: balanced flow minimizes cost and shapes trajectories. Early near‑flatness is the natural starting point of this geometry.
