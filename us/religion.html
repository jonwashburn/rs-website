                <h2>The thesis</h2>
                <p>
                    For centuries many were told that intuition and spirituality were naïve. The core claim here is the opposite:
                    humanity was <em>hearing and feeling</em> something real all along—then doing its best to explain and live it
                    through story, symbol, and practice. The science simply gives you a clean, testable language for
                    that same reality. You don’t need equations to hear the message: there is one reality, attention matters,
                    sincere practice changes outcomes, and love/service make the world measurably better. The science explains <em>why</em>,
                    without asking you to abandon your tradition.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Affirmation, not replacement</strong>: We translate familiar ideas into simple language. Your
                        stories and symbols remain yours.</li>
                    <li><strong>No jargon</strong>: When we say “ledger,” read “the way the world keeps honest balance.” When we say “coherence,” read “clearer attention and unity.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical respect</strong>: If a practice reliably brings peace, insight, and integrity, we show how
                        the science expects that—and how to test and share it.</li>

                <h2>Fulfillment in one paragraph</h2>
                <p>
                    This work makes a fulfillment claim: the unity, rhythm, justice, and compassion that faiths teach are the
                    same patterns the underlying science derives in simple form. One reality (one consciousness), periodic rest and worship
                    (synchronization), moral law (balance), repentance/forgiveness (re‑balancing), love and service (curvature
                    reduction). The language changes; the essence matches.
