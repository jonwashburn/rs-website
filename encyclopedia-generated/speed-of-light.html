    <h1>Speed of Light</h1>
    <p class="summary">The fixed stride of one voxel per tick defines the universal constant c.</p>
    
    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>The speed of light, denoted as \(c\), is a fundamental constant that represents the maximum speed at which information and matter can travel through the universe. It is a cornerstone of modern physics, influencing theories of relativity and the structure of spacetime.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <math-note>
        <p>The speed of light is defined as:</p>
        <p>\(c = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\)</p>
    </math-note>
    
    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>The speed of light is the fastest speed at which anything can travel. In a vacuum, light travels at approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (or about 186,282 miles per second). This speed is not just a number; it plays a crucial role in the laws of physics, particularly in how we understand space and time.</p>
    
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>The speed of light is essential for understanding the universe. It affects how we perceive time and space, leading to the famous equation \(E=mc^2\) from Einstein's theory of relativity. This relationship shows that mass and energy are interchangeable, fundamentally linking them through the speed of light.</p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>In a discrete spacetime lattice, changes in one voxel must propagate to others for interactions to occur. The principles of dynamism and finiteness prevent instantaneous action-at-a-distance, necessitating a maximum speed for these interactions, which is defined as \(c\). This speed is universal, meaning it is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universality:</strong> The speed of light is constant in all inertial frames of reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Invariance:</strong> It does not change regardless of the observer's motion or the source of light.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship with Spacetime:</strong> It defines the structure of spacetime, creating light cones that separate causal and non-causal events.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>

        <summary>Click to expand</summary>
        <p>The relationship between space and time is expressed mathematically through the metric of spacetime, where the speed of light \(c\) acts as the conversion factor between spatial and temporal intervals. This is often represented in the context of the spacetime interval:</p>
        <p>\(s^2 = c^2 t^2 - x^2\)</p>
        <p>Where \(s\) is the spacetime interval, \(t\) is time, and \(x\) is distance.</p>
    </details>
    
    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>The speed of light connects various concepts in physics, including electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. It is integral to the theories of special and general relativity, influencing our understanding of gravity and the expansion of the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Future experiments may test the speed of light under different conditions, such as in varying gravitational fields or within different media. Any deviation from the established value of \(c\) would challenge our current understanding of physics.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>One common misconception is that the speed of light can be exceeded. According to our current understanding of physics, nothing can travel faster than light in a vacuum, as this would violate causality and the fundamental laws of physics.</p>
    
    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is the exact speed of light?</h3>
    <p>The exact speed of light in a vacuum is defined as 299,792,458 meters per second.</p>
    
    <h3>Does the speed of light change in different mediums?</h3>
    <p>Yes, light travels slower in mediums like water or glass compared to a vacuum. However, the speed of light in a vacuum remains constant.</p>
    
    <h3>Why is the speed of light important in relativity?</h3>
    <p>The speed of light is a fundamental limit in the theory of relativity, affecting how we understand time dilation and length contraction for objects moving at high speeds.</p>
