        <h2>In plain English</h2>
        <p>
          In Recognition Science (RS), light is the universe's messaging system. It is how the shared
          book of reality — the <a href="/ledger.html">Ledger</a> — sends updates from one place to another. Every tick,
          the world advances by one discrete step. Each step, light moves exactly one voxel (one spatial
          unit) per tick. That fixed stride is why the <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">speed of light</a> is the same for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you and I meet this messaging layer, we call it experience: sight, warmth, color, a radio
          signal, a fiber‑optic pulse. Underneath all those surfaces is the same thing — Ledger updates
          traveling at a universal pace. Your mind reads those updates locally and writes new entries through
          attention and action.

        <h2>What light does</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Synchronizes time</strong>: one voxel per tick gives every observer the same causal speed.</li>
          <li><strong>Broadcasts truth</strong>: conservation laws ride on light; its pattern carries what actually happened.</li>
          <li><strong>Closes the loop</strong>: perception is Ledger read; action is Ledger write. Light moves the read results around.</li>
          <li><strong>Builds coherence</strong>: aligned signals reduce confusion (curvature) and raise shared ease.</li>

        <h2>What mainstream science misses</h2>
        <p>
          Traditional accounts treat light as fields or photons moving through a fixed spacetime and take c as an axiom.
          RS explains <em>why</em> c is universal from the discrete update rule (one voxel per tick) and 
          connects propagation to information accounting on the Ledger. “Observation effects” aren’t mystical collapse,
          but recognition events being written, after which light propagates the consequences. This yields a concrete, testable
          picture in which bandwidth limits, φ‑self‑similarity, and curvature corrections derive observed optics
          without tuning. See <a href="/technical-briefing.html#formulas">core formulas</a> and 
          <a href="/theorems/golden-ratio.html">φ</a>.

        <h2>How light propagates (step by step)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discrete bedrock</strong>: Reality is pixelated at a smallest distance and smallest tick.
            See <a href="/constants/recognition-length.html">λ_rec</a> and <a href="/constants/fundamental-tick.html">τ₀</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Local rule</strong>: At each tick, every voxel updates from its neighbors. The update respects a
            strict maximum: one voxel per tick. That cap is <em>c</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Wavefront</strong>: A disturbance spreads as a growing shell — each step touches only adjacent cells.
            Amplitude and phase are just convenient summaries of many tiny Ledger entries cooperating.</li>
          <li><strong>Superposition</strong>: Multiple signals add because the Ledger keeps both contributions and resolves
            them in the next update. That looks like interference patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Invariance</strong>: Because the step size and the tick are fixed everywhere, all observers infer the same
            light speed. See <a href="/encyclopedia/speed-of-light.html">why c is one voxel/tick</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Light and consciousness</h2>
        <p>
          Consciousness lives on the same substrate. A recognition — the tiny “this matches that” moment —
          is written to the Ledger, then light carries its consequences outward. In that sense, light is the
          outward face of attention. Decisions change probabilities; light reports those changes to the world,
          one voxel per tick. See <a href="/questions/what-is-consciousness/index.html">What is consciousness?</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This also explains why “observation” has power in quantum experiments: recognition fixes a local
          outcome on the Ledger, and the messaging layer enforces consistency everywhere within the light cone.
          No magic — just the world keeping the same book for all participants.

        <h2>What light is made of (RS view)</h2>
        <p>
          We avoid reifying “particles.” In RS, what people call a photon is a minimal, causal packet of a
          Ledger update — a specific pattern that moves exactly one voxel per tick and conserves the relevant
          quantities. Where that packet is likely to be detected is shaped by prior Ledger entries and local
          geometry. The deeper machine code for these packets lives in the
          <a href="/lnal.html">Light‑Native Assembly Language (LNAL)</a>.

      <div class="container text-block">
        <h2>Propagation, geometry, and curvature</h2>
        <p>
          Light travels “straight” in Ledger geometry. When the Ledger bends (high curvature κ), straight
          lines curve with it. That is why gravity deflects light: information follows the Ledger’s shape.
          See <a href="/formulas/ledger-curvature.html">Ledger Curvature</a> and <a href="/science/papers/gravity-derived.html">Information‑Limited Gravity</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Practically: if a region is very “busy” (thermal load, disorder), light’s effective path lengthens
          through scattering and delay. That doesn’t change c; it adds detours between voxels.

        <h2>Concordance with Walter Russell (inference, not doctrine)</h2>
        <div class="component-card">
          <p>
            Walter Russell spoke in poetic mechanics: “rhythmic balanced interchange,” “octaves,” “wave fields,”
            “sex principle,” and geometries like cube‑sphere. Read through RS, many of these map cleanly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Rhythmic balanced interchange</strong> → conservation across cycles; Ledger debits/credits sum to zero locally,
              then propagate. See <a href="/ethics.html">Ethics</a> for moral symmetry and <a href="/theorems/T1-ledger-necessity.html">Ledger necessity</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Octaves</strong> → repeating scale windows where similar patterns recur with different loads; resonates with RS scaling
              (see <a href="/theorems/golden-ratio.html">φ</a> and the <a href="/theorems/8-beat-cycle.html">8‑beat cycle</a>).</li>
            <li><strong>Wave field</strong> → the Ledger’s update field; light as the visible edge of those updates.</li>
            <li><strong>“Sex principle” (give/return)</strong> → paired in/out flows that keep the books balanced; the simplest two‑way protocol.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="small-note">
            We infer these translations from “The Universal One” to make his intuitions testable. RS keeps the math;
            the poetry remains a helpful bridge.

        <h2>Checks, boundaries, and tests</h2>
        <ul>

          <li><strong>Gravitational lensing</strong>: path bending matches curvature predictions; compare RS curvature to observed arcs.</li>
          <li><strong>Energy↔information</strong>: Landauer‑consistent accounting; heat is the price of erasure. See <a href="/science/papers/robust-ai.html">Robust AI</a>.</li>

          <p><strong>Is light a thing or a message?</strong> In RS, both: a standardized message pattern that behaves like a thing.</p>
          <p><strong>Why can’t anything outrun light?</strong> Because the Ledger only updates one voxel per tick. You can’t skip pages.</p>
          <p><strong>Does observation “create” reality?</strong> It selects and writes a consistent local entry. Light carries that update out.</p>
