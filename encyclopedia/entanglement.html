    <h2>Essence</h2>
    <p>Entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum physics characterized by the correlation of properties between particles that are spatially separated. In Recognition Science, this is interpreted as shared double-entry across separated voxels, where the ledger maintains a record of these correlations without the need for direct interaction.</p>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <math-note>Entanglement can be mathematically represented in terms of the wave function, where the state of a system of two particles can be expressed as a superposition of their individual states.</math-note>
    <p>In formal terms, if two particles are entangled, their joint state cannot be factored into the product of their individual states, which is expressed as:</p>
    <math-note>
        \[
        |\Psi\rangle = \sum_{i,j} c_{ij} |a_i\rangle |b_j\rangle
        \]
    </math-note>

    <h2>In Plain English</h2>
    <p>Entanglement means that two or more particles can be connected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This nonlocal connection challenges classical intuitions about separateness and locality, suggesting a deeper interconnectedness in the fabric of reality.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Understanding entanglement is crucial for various applications in quantum technology, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. It also raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the limits of classical physics, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of information and causality.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>In the context of the ledger framework, entanglement arises from the ledger's ability to maintain a coherent record of interactions across separated voxels. When two particles become entangled, their states are recorded in such a way that a change in one is reflected in the other, preserving the integrity of the ledger without requiring direct communication between the particles.</p>

    <h2>Key Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nonlocality:</strong> Changes to one particle's state affect the other instantaneously, regardless of distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Superposition:</strong> Entangled particles exist in a combination of states until measured.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurement Correlation:</strong> Measurements of entangled particles show correlated outcomes that cannot be explained by classical physics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>

        <p>The mathematical description of entanglement involves the use of Hilbert spaces and tensor products. For two entangled particles, the state can be expressed as:</p>
        <math-note>
            \[
            |\Psi\rangle = \alpha |00\rangle + \beta |11\rangle
            \]
        </math-note>
        <p>where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are complex coefficients that describe the probability amplitudes of the respective states.</p>
    </details>

    <h2>Connections</h2>
    <p>Entanglement is closely related to other concepts in quantum mechanics, such as <a href="/encyclopedia/quantum-entanglement.html">quantum correlations</a> and the <a href="/encyclopedia/wave-function.html">wave function</a>. It also has implications for the <a href="/encyclopedia/information-theory.html">information theory</a>, as it challenges traditional notions of information transfer and locality.</p>

    <h2>Testable Predictions</h2>
    <p>Entanglement leads to several predictions that can be tested experimentally, such as violations of Bell's inequalities. These tests confirm the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics and the validity of entangled states.</p>

    <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>A common misconception is that entangled particles communicate with each other faster than light. In reality, entanglement does not involve any signal or information transfer; it merely reflects correlations established at the moment of entanglement.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What is the significance of entanglement in quantum computing?</h3>
    <p>Entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing, enabling qubits to perform complex calculations more efficiently than classical bits.</p>

    <h3>Can entanglement be broken?</h3>
    <p>Yes, entanglement can be broken by interactions with the environment, a process known as decoherence, which leads to the loss of the entangled state.</p>
