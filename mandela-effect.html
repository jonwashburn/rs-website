          <p><strong>At a glance</strong>: There is one necessary world (one Ledger), rendered by many minds (compilers). Memory is a lossy, social process. When large groups “remember” the same wrong thing, it’s not proof of parallel worlds — it’s how shared rendering and rehearsal work.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What it is (plain)</h2>
        <p>The Mandela Effect is when lots of people confidently remember the same detail that never happened: spellings, logos, movie lines, timelines. It feels spooky because the confidence is real. The detail isn’t.</p>

        <h2>What it isn’t</h2>
        <p>It isn’t evidence of hopping between parallel universes. If you’re looking for the deeper picture of “one vs many,” read <a href="/multiverse.html">The Multiverse & Our Place in the Cosmos</a>. The many live in how we render and rehearse, not in extra places.</p>

        <h2>How it happens (mechanisms)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Schema substitution</strong>: Brains auto‑correct details to fit familiar patterns (Berenstain → “Berenstein”).</li>
          <li><strong>Compression at recall</strong>: We store gist more than pixels. On retrieval, we fill gaps with the most likely shape.</li>
          <li><strong>Typographic/phonetic drift</strong>: Similar letters and sounds nudge memories toward common forms.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand and media updates</strong>: Quiet logo/tagline changes overwrite earlier traces via repetition.</li>
          <li><strong>Social rehearsal</strong>: Repeated group telling writes the version the group will later remember.</li>
          <li><strong>Coherence bursts</strong>: Highly synced groups can adopt the same substitution at once, boosting confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>First exposure bias</strong>: Early, wrong copies prime long‑term recall, even after correction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Predictions and tests</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Coherence → consensus</strong>: Higher group coherence (shared rhythm/attention) increases agreement on the same wrong detail.</li>
          <li><strong>Grapheme distance</strong>: Error rates scale with visual/phonetic similarity; we can predict which spellings drift.</li>
          <li><strong>Rehearsal strength</strong>: Confidence tracks repetition more than truth; primary‑source checks collapse confidence fast.</li>
          <li><strong>Multilingual asymmetry</strong>: Languages with tighter orthography show smaller, different drift patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Stamped snapshots</strong>: Personal archives with time‑stamped images reduce later false consensus in those users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to do (ledger‑aligned recall)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pause before amplifying; attach a source or say “uncertain.”</li>
          <li>Keep lightweight receipts (screenshots, links) for claims you repeat often.</li>
          <li>Favor reversible updates; if you’re wrong, repair publicly and quickly.</li>
          <li>Use weekly “memory audits” for teams: 5 minutes to check one shared assumption against a primary source.</li>
        </ul>
